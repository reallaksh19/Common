# V3.1 agent task publication lifecycle

## Purpose

Define the normal durable interaction between an engineering agent, its owned child issue, V3.1 recording, the programme Handover ledger and the coordinator.

This is a reconstruction protocol, not an execution gate.

## 1. Child issue is the task home

For new multi-agent programmes:

- the **programme parent** carries the governing programme contract;
- the **child implementation issue** carries the bounded engineering responsibility;
- the agent publishes its implementation plan and task evidence on that child issue;
- the dedicated **[Relay Handover]** child indexes the current programme-wide operational picture.

In V3.1 terms, a new EP may therefore carry:

```yaml
programme_parent:
  repository: owner/repo
  number: 210
  ...

parent_issue:
  repository: owner/repo
  number: 232
  ...
```

For compatibility, older EPs may have only `parent_issue`; V3.1 then treats that issue as both work issue and programme parent for reconstruction.

## 2. Two-pass separates system understanding from approved engineering intent

Pass 1 independently reconstructs the live repository/application without seeing the actual issue/task or being asked for a next action.

Pass 2 receives that baseline plus the actual task, refreshes live evidence, identifies zero or more legitimate high-ROI Improvement Proposals, quantifies them, reconciles the task, and shows the Owner a draft implementation plan in chat.

The first Pass-2 response is **not** durable engineering intent. It must stop for explicit Owner approval.

After approval, the same agent refreshes volatile reality and publishes the approved implementation plan on the original owned issue. Approved in-scope IP-* proposals are embedded in that plan. Approved adjacent proposals use a separate responsibility/EP rather than silently widening the issue.

## 3. First durable agent publication — IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN

Normal expectation:

> After live revalidation and before substantial material modification, publish `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN — rev 1` on the owned child implementation issue.

This is a strong reconstruction convention, not permission.

For deterministic provider reconstruction, the durable comment should **begin with the typed publication heading**. Pass-1/Pass-2 reasoning or long execution narrative may contain the same ideas, but it is not the approved durable implementation plan.

If useful implementation/investigation already happened before the plan was posted, the work remains valid. Publish the current plan as soon as practical and continue.

Do not wait for Relay/coordinator approval after publishing the plan.

Recommended shape:

```text
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN — rev 1

BASIS
- exact current main/head
- relevant parent programme basis
- owned child responsibility ref + observed body/contract digest, when available
- three-pass packet ref, when used

MY UNDERSTANDING
What I believe the real engineering problem is.

OWNED OUTCOME
What I intend to make true.

SOURCE TRUTH
What I inspected and which source is authoritative.

APPROACH
The implementation strategy I currently intend to use.

PLAN SLICES
Use stable STEP-* IDs. Each meaningful slice records current state and the AC-* criteria it supports.

EXPECTED CHANGED SURFACES
Files/components/interfaces likely to change.

DEPENDENCIES
Required production outputs from other workstreams.

INDEPENDENT WORK
What can proceed even if those outputs are not yet available.

FALSIFIER
What would prove this plan unnecessary, wrong or differently scoped.

VALIDATION
Focused tests/oracles/runtime/browser evidence.

PRESERVE
Existing behavior/contracts that must remain true.

UNCERTAINTIES
What is not yet known.

EXPECTED NEXT OBSERVABLE
The next concrete evidence a coordinator should expect.

CONSUMER / HANDOFF
Who needs the result and what they need from it.
```

## 4. EP role

An EP is V3.1's bounded task/execution identity.

It is **not** the agent's implementation plan and does not replace the child issue.

One meaningful engineering responsibility should normally map to one EP, not one EP per command/file/test.

Do not create nano-EPs for:

- inspect file;
- edit helper;
- run test;
- post issue comment;
- create PR.

A new EP is appropriate when the owned engineering responsibility materially changes or a distinct follow-up/revision becomes a new task.

### Plan timing relative to EP

The preferred new-task sequence is:

```text
child responsibility
→ agent plan
→ V3.1 records/binds EP + plan basis
→ execution
```

But an EP may already exist before an incoming agent publishes its plan, for example when a three-pass/handover packet was prepared from existing V3.1 context.

In that case:

```text
existing EP
→ incoming agent publishes plan
→ TASK_SNAPSHOT/Handover observes current plan ref/revision
```

Do **not** create a replacement EP merely because the implementation plan was first published or revised.

## 5. Plan revisions — PLAN_UPDATE

A material implementation-learning change stays on the same task/EP when responsibility remains the same.

Publish:

```text
PLAN_UPDATE — rev N

CHANGED BECAUSE
New evidence.

PREVIOUS ASSUMPTION
What was wrong/incomplete.

NEW APPROACH
What changes.

UNCHANGED
Outcome, ownership boundary, invariants and consumer contract that remain stable.

EXPECTED NEXT OBSERVABLE
What the coordinator should now expect.
```

Use a new EP/child only if the engineering responsibility itself has materially changed.

A correction/narrowing that changes the intended material approach is still a `PLAN_UPDATE` even when it appears during a long reasoning pass. Label it durably rather than forcing the coordinator to infer the semantic transition from prose.

## 6. Meaningful intermediate evidence — TASK_EVIDENCE

Do not post every action.

Post a durable evidence update when it changes reconstruction or another workstream's next action.

```text
TASK_EVIDENCE

OBSERVED AT
...

EXACT HEAD / BASIS
...

CLAIM
...

EVIDENCE
...

RESULT
PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL | NOT_RUN | PENDING | OBSERVED

REASON CLASS
CURRENT_TASK | UPSTREAM_DEPENDENCY | SIBLING_WORKSTREAM | PREEXISTING_UNRELATED | INFRASTRUCTURE | PROVIDER | OWNER_DECISION | UNKNOWN

CONSEQUENCE
...

DEPENDENCY DISCOVERED
NONE | <missing production truth>

PLAN CONSEQUENCE
NONE | PLAN_UPDATE required

BLOCKING CONDITION
NONE | <production fact that prevents useful continuation>

UNBLOCK CONDITION
NONE | <externally observable fact that permits revalidation>

EXPECTED NEXT OBSERVABLE
<the next useful evidence/event, especially when waiting>
```

Useful triggers include:

- falsifier result;
- newly discovered production dependency;
- consumer-ready producer output;
- important verified negative result;
- runtime/browser evidence that materially changes the plan;
- local/helper result that now matters outside the local workstream.

Routine chatter is not a publication requirement.

## 7. Delivery / handoff — TASK_RESULT

At the meaningful task delivery boundary publish a comment whose first durable heading is `TASK_RESULT`. Final exact-main/integration acceptance is also a TASK_RESULT when that is the owned responsibility.

```text
TASK_RESULT

OUTCOME
ACHIEVED | PARTIAL | FALSIFIED

EXACT MATERIAL
branch
PR
base
head

CHANGED SURFACES
path/component → purpose

VALIDATION
command/oracle → result

PROVED
...

NOT PROVED
...

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
...

NEGATIVE ASSURANCE
What intentionally did not change.

CONSUMER CONSEQUENCE
Which downstream work can now consume what.

REMAINING DEPENDENCY
...

NEXT
...
```

The PR/commit/test/artifact is the material truth. The comment is the durable semantic handoff/index.

Provider issue lifecycle is separate from responsibility completion: a valid `TASK_RESULT` may establish that the bounded responsibility is complete even if the GitHub issue remains open for readback or programme chronology.

## Acceptance and progress denominators

Use stable IDs:

```text
programme: EXIT-*
child/work issue: AC-*
implementation plan: STEP-*
```

Task Snapshot percentages come only from those declared criteria/weights.

Do not use these as progress denominators:

- PR count;
- commit count;
- file count;
- test count;
- chat volume;
- publication count.

When a denominator is absent, V3.1 reports `UNKNOWN / UNMAPPED`.

## 8. V3.1 read models

V3.1 may observe the child issue and expose in `TASK_SNAPSHOT`:

```text
programme_parent
parent_issue / work issue
planning.state
planning.provider_ref
planning.revision
planning.digest
planning.observed_at
planning.expected_next_observable
task_publications[]
```

Plan state is:

```text
PRESENT
MISSING
STALE
UNKNOWN
```

A missing/stale plan is reconstruction debt only.

### Owner-facing status rule

After a meaningful `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN`, `PLAN_UPDATE`, `TASK_EVIDENCE`, or `TASK_RESULT` changes current reconstruction, refresh the **issue-local** Task Snapshot from live provider/material state and use its rendered form as the primary status surface shown to the Owner.

Do not substitute a narrative activity summary such as "updated issue / created branch / added tests" when the Owner is asking for task status.

The rendered status must make these distinctions visible when applicable:

- parent/programme progress checklist;
- current child/task acceptance checklist;
- current plan revision and expected next observable;
- implementation versus verification;
- `NOT_RUN` versus `FAIL`;
- provider issue state versus responsibility completion;
- PR lifecycle, base and current material head;
- stacked/related PRs;
- what is done;
- what remains;
- next useful observable/action.

If `CURRENT_SNAPSHOT` belongs to another EP/responsibility, it must not masquerade as the current issue's status. Generate/read the issue-local snapshot under `relay/GENERATED/tasks/**` instead.

Narrative prose may follow the rendered snapshot for context, but it is secondary.

## 9. [Relay Handover] programme ledger

The programme Handover ledger should index each EP/workstream with:

- child work issue;
- plan state/ref/revision;
- expected next observable;
- branch/PR/exact-head material where available;
- latest meaningful task publications;
- dependency/output consequences;
- current task result/handoff.

It should not duplicate full implementation-plan prose.

## 10. Coordinator use

The coordinator watches **expectations**, not agent activity.

```text
EXPECTED
What concrete evidence did the plan say should appear next?

OBSERVED
What durable material/evidence actually exists?

CONSEQUENCE
What changes for this task, another workstream, the plan, the Owner, or the next observation?
```

Examples:

- plan published → expect focused falsifier/PR;
- producer result landed → route to consumer immediately;
- plan changed → retire obsolete timer and watch new expected observable;
- session disappeared → reconstruct from child issue + plan + EP + PR/head/evidence;
- no meaningful change → do nothing.

## 11. Non-blocking invariant

None of the following is engineering permission:

- plan presence;
- plan revision;
- EP state;
- Handover freshness;
- task-publication count;
- timer state;
- coordinator observation;
- V3.1 lease/checkpoint/control state.

Actual production constraints come from source truth, the engineering problem, evidence/tests/runtime, human decisions and real provider permissions.

## 12. V3.1 only

Use Engineering Relay V3.1 only for current recorder/reconstruction/reporting semantics.

Do not use V3 or V2.5 as live coordination, recovery, gating, handover or Owner-command protocols.
