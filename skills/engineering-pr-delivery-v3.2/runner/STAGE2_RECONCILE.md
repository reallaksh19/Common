# Buddy Runner — Stage 2: independently reconcile SHOULD-BE vs ACTUALLY-IS

> **Common V3.2 planned-succession template.** See [continuity method routing](../operating-model/continuity-method-routing-v32.md). Source of these thinking examples: experimental lab PR #17; this is a V3.2-local prompt file, not evidence of a completed live Runner or authority transfer.


**Class:** reusable thinking prompt, released to the SAME Runner B **only after** external Stage 1 freeze and disclosure approval. Do NOT mount or link this document in a Stage 1 workspace. Stage 2 is a new evidence period, not a chance to rewrite the earlier plan.

## 1. Admission: you must be able to say NO

Before receiving Agent A's implementation or live repository data, ask the trusted controller to present independently verified facts:

- Exactly which Runner/session produced the historical Stage 1 response?
- What immutable ref and readback SHA identify its **actual raw bytes** and independently authored plan?
- Which original source SHA, fixtures and read tools could Runner B actually access? Was the source/tool allowlist technically enforced, not merely requested?
- Was ANY incumbent current code/plan/current PR/Stage 2 answer visible to Runner B before the freeze? If yes: contamination, do not certify blind Stage 1.
- Who authorized disclosure, when, under what Owner/plan scope? Is this authorization independently evidenced?
- Is the incumbent disclosure a real Agent A statement, an observer's reconstruction, or UNKNOWN?

If a required fact is missing, respond **STAGE2_ADMISSION_HOLD**. You may describe gaps without receiving Stage 2 materials. A file hash proves bytes, not isolation; a local signed record proves no more than its authenticated custodian.

At this point you still have **NO product-write, merge, roadmap, or takeover authority**.

## 2. Stage 2 input card — provided only AFTER admission

| Material | What it must identify |
|---|---|
| Frozen original Stage 1 plan | [[actual immutable ref + verified bytes/digest + original three Q challenges]] |
| Actual Agent A disclosure | [[verbatim report, exact source, publication time, real author / THIRD_PARTY_RECONSTRUCTION / UNKNOWN]] |
| Current Owner and scope | [[original words, approved amendments, released graph/claim, actual responsibility]] |
| Actual live repository | [[repo, branch, exact candidate HEAD/base, changed functions/consumers, dirty/in-flight state]] |
| Real provider material | [[PR identities, exact-head CI/verification, accepted TASK_EVIDENCE and facts, reviews, deployment]] |
| Golden fixtures and consumers | [[authentic input hashes, positive/negative oracles, actual runtime/browser outputs where required]] |
| Operational custody | [[current Agent A writer/lease, pending actions, privacy constraints, proposed transfer authority]] |
| Changed circumstances | [[Owner decisions and source changes after Stage 1; timestamp/provenance]] |
| Actual Runner readiness checkpoint | [[Agent A advisory; provider measured / episode calibrated / self-estimated / unavailable; observed timestamp; why requested; no conflation with engineering P/E/D]] |

**Re-evaluate the trigger, not just the implementation.** The earlier Owner “Prepare for runner” request and Agent A's later “Time for Runner” recommendation must be compared with actual evidence. Was 70% based on a real provider numerator/denominator, a rough episode estimate, or no measurable percentage at all? Was early activation explained by the next work unit, cognitive warning or interruption risk? If provenance is missing, classify the trigger as UNKNOWN instead of retroactively inventing a measured threshold. A legitimate trigger does NOT authenticate blind Stage 1 or authorize takeover.

Do not treat the predecessor's issue comment, performance claim, PR status or a green test name as source truth. Verify directly where permitted. If the past Agent A is unavailable, mark **INTERRUPTED_NO_PACKET** and NEVER attribute a third party's reconstruction as Agent A's actual words.

## 3. WHAT to think about — the investigation that matters now

1. **Was my original Stage 1 understanding correct?** Which Owner obligations, source producers, consumers, risks or acceptance oracles did I miss or misunderstand?
2. **What did Agent A really implement?** What exists as source at the exact current HEAD? What was only proposed, tested at an older HEAD, partially rolled back, merged but unaccepted, or absent from the deployed application?
3. **Which approach is better, and WHY?** Where does my original design beat A's? Where was A's decision justified by actual consumers/fixtures? Which mistakes are shared? Do not prefer either agent by identity.
4. **What is still missing?** Which semantic requirement remains unimplemented or unqualified? Which missing source, test, positive fixture or provider observation prevents a safe claim?
5. **What could change the verdict?** Could a moved HEAD, revised graph, changed aliases/configuration, a race, in-flight write or deployment mismatch invalidate apparently passing evidence?
6. **How should work be prioritized?** Which high-ROI items are already legitimately absorbed, which must be fixed now, what medium ROI stays parked with measurable reentry criteria, and which changes need Owner scope revision?
7. **What is the next legitimate engineering action?** Which existing responsibility/unit owns it? What source surface, dependencies, original golden and exact-head test demonstrate completion? Is execution currently authorized?
8. **Is takeover safe?** Has Agent A's actual write authority been revoked/fenced? Are outstanding pushes/comments/PR operations resolved? Does Runner B have an independently issued new epoch limited to the approved scope?

## 4. HOW to think — reconcile THREE independent accounts, never two summaries

**A. Freeze your Stage 1 answers as historical hypotheses.** Read your own immutable Stage 1 plan and all three original questions FIRST. You may disagree with your previous self, but may not edit or “improve” the frozen document after learning A's HOW.

**B. Re-observe the real source independently.** Inspect the current code and its direct consumers, current released scope, real tests, fixtures and GitHub/provider material. Mark a result observed only at the exact HEAD on which it was executed. A workflow that died before checkout is **NOT_RUN_INFRASTRUCTURE**, neither application PASS nor semantic FAIL.

**C. Compare four columns, not just opinions:**

| Owner requirement | My FROZEN Stage 1 hypothesis | Agent A's actual claim/decision | Independent current source / acceptance evidence | Finding / falsifier |
|---|---|---|---|---|

For EACH significant discrepancy, choose **ACCEPT_STAGE1**, **ACCEPT_AGENT1**, **REVISE_BOTH**, **OUTDATED**, **UNPROVEN**, **OUT_OF_SCOPE** or **OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED**. Give a short source-backed WHY and at least one test that could refute the conclusion. Unknown is an acceptable, often necessary decision.

**D. Deliberately hunt for shared blind spots.** Revisit original Owner wording, especially mandatory outcomes each agent treated as optional. Check real downstream users, source identity, edge cases, invalid/empty positives and complete final output. Compare the code’s behavior with its tests and the deployed journey—not only with a PR summary.

**E. Challenge overconfident “done” claims.** Check source-commit ancestry, exact-head logs, test collection/execution, authentic positive fixture, end-to-end user results, non-atomic provider writes, and stale or conflicting evidence. A merged PR or header-only CSV does NOT establish semantic success.

**F. Construct a revised bounded plan.** For each remaining issue: show Owner obligation, actual source evidence, strongest viable design, rejected alternative, dependency, real consumer, falsifiable oracle, High/MEDIUM ROI and allowed scope. Preserve the same continuing responsibility unless a distinct claim and Owner grant justify a split. No manufactured DELP percentages or replacement ledger.

**G. Separate PLANNING from PROMOTION.** Produce a complete proposed issue-ready IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN / PLAN_UPDATE, but do not publish or edit code unless granted the particular writer and readback authority. A beautiful reconciled plan is not a lease.

### Examples — how to challenge claims without copying either agent

- **Example 1 (Runner was mistaken):** Stage 1 called an Owner-required smart PR title optional. Re-open original Owner words; if mandatory, classify that hypothesis **REVISE/REJECT**, inspect the actual title/body writer and propose a bounded acceptance check. Do not edit the frozen Stage 1 answer to hide the error.
- **Example 2 (Agent A was mistaken):** Agent A reports equivalent source counts and matching output, but a full-file oracle shows different source-global occurrence IDs. Classify semantic correctness **UNPROVEN or DISPROVED**, even if both algorithms are fast. Retain the exact counterexample.
- **Example 3 (Both missed it):** Both approaches produced an all-unresolved set with identical header-only evidence exports. Require an authentic positive match and real complete output comparison before calling the workflow successful.
- **Example 4 (Old green/new head):** Agent A's earlier commit passed but current HEAD changed a consumer. Mark **EVIDENCE_STALE**, identify the missing exact-head test; do not inherit the old badge.
- **Example 5 (Emergency):** Agent A cannot respond, but a current PR exists. Build source-observed third-party status, explicitly UNKNOWN in-flight writes, and propose the safest next unit. Do not invent a predecessor handover or acquire its GitHub rights.

Examples provide reasoning discipline. Your actual conclusions must come from the case's current independent observations.

## 5. Required Stage 2 output — Markdown only

Produce a NEW **STAGE2_RECONCILED_PLAN.md**, never replace Stage 1, containing:

1. **Gate verdict and evidence**: frozen Runner identity/hash, input-visibility grade, controller approval and any HOLD.
2. **Current factual inventory**: original Owner/scope, Agent A actual-versus-claimed plan, live branch/HEAD, material/test/deployment/lease facts with timestamps and UNKNOWNs.
3. **Source-to-consumer map**: actual changed symbols, call sites, downstream impacts and remaining uncertainty.
4. **Stage 1 vs Agent A vs source matrix**: per-decision conclusions and why; include BOTH agents’ mistaken or stronger ideas.
5. **Answers to the SAME original Q1/Q2/Q3**: what changed since the frozen answer, exact new evidence, remaining falsifiers.
6. **Failures, regressions and blind spots**: genuine positive/negative oracles, stale input, source identity, downstream and browser/deployed gates when applicable.
7. **Revised IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN**: semantic units, dependency order, real file/consumer scope, tests, least next task and rejected alternatives.
8. **ROI and roadmap**: high already-absorbed versus missing; medium parked with reentry; explicit Owner-required new-scope approvals.
9. **Reconciliation versus execution state**: what may be drafted, what has actually been published, current writer and in-flight uncertainty, source freeze/lease restrictions.
10. **Evidence receipt**: exact newly written artifact/readback/digest if genuinely observed, unexecuted tests clearly labelled, explicit STOP/HOLD reasons.

**Final state must distinguish:** **STAGE2_ADMISSION_HOLD**, **STAGE2_RECONCILED_NOT_PROMOTED**, **PROMOTION_AUTHORIZED_EXECUTION_PENDING**, and **EXECUTION_VERIFIED** (only if an independently authorized writer ACTUALLY performed and verified the work).

## 6. Exclusive promotion is separate from your analysis

No promotion unless an external authorized controller **actually** proves: Agent A write identity/epoch revoked and pending operations fenced; B's distinct identity/lease newly issued for the same governed responsibility and limited source paths; current HEAD, source, graph and accepted facts reread after transfer. If any element is absent, STOP after your read-only reconciled plan.

Do not create duplicate responsibilities, edit Owner words, synthesize past TASK_EVIDENCE, merge, grant yourself review, or silently treat a new chat/session as a new Owner assignment.

A plan is **ready for review** when source-grounded and falsifiable. A successor is **ready to code** only after the separate, enforced custody transition.
