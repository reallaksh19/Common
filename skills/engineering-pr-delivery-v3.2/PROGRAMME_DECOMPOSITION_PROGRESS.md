# Engineering Relay V3.2 — programme decomposition and progress denominator

> **Implementation status (DELP).** The progress/title projection and the rule that executors report facts but never author percentages or titles are now implemented and mechanically enforced by `operating-model/durable-execution-lineage-projection-v32.md` (`scripts/delp_projection_v32.py`, `schemas/delp-*-v32.schema.yaml`, `tests/test_delp_projection_v32.py`). Where this document shows an older title form, the DELP grammar governs. The rest of this document keeps its existing status.

## Normative status

This file is a normative addendum for the V3.2 planning/progress slice on this candidate branch.

It does not change the core rule that V3.2 progress is denominator-based. It defines how a Coordinator-governed programme/phase decomposition supplies a stable denominator to nested engineering responsibilities and how progress rolls up without allowing executor guesswork, split gaming, or liveness to manufacture completion.

Where this file conflicts with ad-hoc percentage estimates, issue-count percentages, LOC-derived percentages, or executor self-estimates, this file controls for this slice.

## Governing invariant

> **The Coordinator owns the declared denominator; executors own evidence against that denominator. Progress is never guessed by the executor. Parent and Phase percentages are deterministic roll-ups of planned weights and current valid evidence. Splits conserve weight, progressive decomposition consumes reserved weight, genuine scope expansion changes the denominator explicitly, and liveness/status remains independent from percentage completion.**

## Three progress levels

Use distinct progress semantics at each layer:

```text
PRD / COMMENT BLOCK
  P = nested engineering semantic progress
  E = evidenced nested engineering progress

PHASE ISSUE
  D = Local delivery progress across PRDs + phase acceptance/integration
  E = evidenced delivery progress

PARENT / PROGRAMME ISSUE
  D = weighted roll-up of phase delivery progress
  E = weighted roll-up of phase evidenced progress
```

A nested Coder `P=100%` MUST NOT imply the Local responsibility, Phase, or Programme is complete.

## Programme Decomposition Manifest

Before production release, the Coordinator SHOULD establish a machine-readable decomposition manifest containing at minimum:

```yaml
programme:
  id: <stable programme id>
  parent_issue: <provider ref>
  owner_basis_ref: <ref>
  coordinator_principal: <principal>
  local_protocol_ref: <exact ref>
  engineering_protocol_ref: <exact ref>
  acceptance_epoch: <id>
  project_protocol_ref: <ref>
  project_protocol_digest: <digest>

  progress_model:
    total_weight: 10000

  phases:
    - id: PHASE-A
      issue: <ref>
      weight: <integer>
```

For a fixed-denominator programme:

```text
sum(phase.weight) = programme.progress_model.total_weight
```

`10000` is a recommended convenient basis-point denominator, not a mandatory literal value.

## Phase Manifest

Each Phase issue SHOULD have a machine-readable Phase Manifest:

```yaml
phase:
  id: PHASE-C
  programme: <programme id>
  issue: <provider ref>
  coordinator: <principal>
  outcome: <one bounded phase outcome>

  entrance_conditions: [...]
  exit_conditions: [...]
  dependencies: [...]

  weight: 2200

  delivery_pools:
    responsibility_delivery: 1900
    phase_integration: 200
    phase_qualification: 100

  responsibilities:
    - PRD-C01
    - PRD-C02
    - PRD-C03

  undecomposed_reserve_weight: <integer>
```

Invariant:

```text
allocated responsibility weights
+ undecomposed reserve
+ phase integration/qualification weights
= phase weight
```

A Phase cannot claim 100% merely because all currently instantiated COMMENT BLOCKs are complete while reserve or phase-level gates remain unresolved.

## Responsibility Block / PRD schema

Each responsibility SHOULD declare:

```yaml
responsibility:
  id: PRD-<stable-id>
  phase: PHASE-C

  representation:
    kind: COMMENT_BLOCK | SINGLE_ISSUE | CONTINUATION
    issue: <container ref>
    block: <stable block id>
    spec_comment_ref: <ref>

  outcome: <single coherent engineering outcome>
  dependencies: [...]
  write_surface: [...]

  size_budget:
    target_minutes: 15
    hard_minutes: 20
    target_reviewable_loc: 700
    hard_reviewable_loc: 1500

  progress_weight: <integer>

  acceptance_profile:
    ref: <ref>
    digest: <digest>

  nested_engineering_responsibility:
    id: ENG-PRD-<id>-CODER
```

## Semantic implementation units

Nested engineering progress MUST be based on declared semantic units, not LOC, elapsed time, commits, tool calls, tests executed, or model confidence.

Example:

```yaml
implementation_units:
  - id: U1
    outcome: constraint candidate model
    weight: 25
  - id: U2
    outcome: candidate ranking implementation
    weight: 35
  - id: U3
    outcome: grammar-aware rejection
    weight: 20
  - id: U4
    outcome: focused deterministic tests
    weight: 20
```

Invariant:

```text
sum(unit.weight) = 100
```

Then:

```text
P = completed semantic-unit weight / declared semantic-unit weight
E = completed semantic-unit weight with current successor-safe evidence / declared semantic-unit weight
```

Executors report unit state and evidence. They do not manually choose the displayed percentage.

## Local delivery denominator for one PRD

Coder progress is only part of Local delivery. A PRD SHOULD also define delivery units for Reviewer, Super Reviewer and final handoff/binding.

Recommended default when a project-specific acceptance profile does not provide better weights:

```text
CODER semantic units      60
REVIEWER acceptance       20
SUPER REVIEW              15
FINAL handoff/binding      5
                         ---
                         100
```

Where practical, Reviewer/Super Reviewer weights SHOULD instead be derived from explicit required acceptance methods in the pinned Acceptance Profile.

Thus:

```text
Coder P100/E100
Reviewer not started
Super Review not started
```

must not project Local delivery `D100`.

## Split conservation

A `RESPONSIBILITY_SPLIT` MUST conserve the source responsibility's programme/phase weight.

Example:

```text
C03 weight 300
  -> C03A weight 100
  -> C03B weight 120
  -> C03C weight 80
```

Validator requirement:

```text
sum(successor weights) = source weight
```

A split, replacement executor, replacement PR, retry, acceptance replay, or same-stage fresh attempt does not increase the denominator.

The source responsibility becomes an immutable historical record such as `SUPERSEDED_BY_SPLIT`; its weight is carried by its successors and is not double-counted.

## Progressive decomposition and reserve

The Coordinator is not required to fully micro-specify every future Responsibility Block at programme start. Use explicit `UNDECOMPOSED_RESERVE` weight.

Example:

```text
Phase C weight = 2200
C01 = 300
C02 = 250
C03 = 300
phase integration/qualification = 300
reserve = 1050
```

Later wave planning consumes reserve without changing the denominator:

```text
reserve 1050
 -> C04 300
 -> C05 300
 -> C06 250
 -> reserve 200
```

Reserve is unfinished delivery work. It contributes zero completion until allocated/dispositioned under the governing plan.

## Genuine scope expansion

A true new scope discovery is not a split and MUST NOT silently consume unrelated existing weight if doing so would misrepresent the original plan.

Use an explicit `PLAN_UPDATE — SCOPE_EXPANSION` or equivalent governed event.

The Coordinator must record:

```text
old denominator
new scope
newly allocated weight
new denominator
reason
Owner/authority basis when required
```

A legitimate denominator expansion may reduce displayed percentages. That is truthful and MUST NOT be hidden by renormalizing completed work to preserve a previous percentage.

## Mechanical/generated delta classification

Responsibility-size and progress semantics SHOULD distinguish:

```text
SEMANTIC_DELTA
MECHANICAL_DELTA
GENERATED_DELTA
```

A large deterministic tree copy or generated artifact may exceed ordinary LOC budgets while containing little or no semantic work.

Such a migration SHOULD be isolated as a dedicated mechanical responsibility with reproducibility/equality proof, while semantic changes remain in a separately reviewable bounded responsibility.

Mechanical/generated LOC MUST NOT itself create progress.

## Checkpoint thresholds are not split thresholds

Keep these separate:

```text
CHECKPOINT THRESHOLD
  bounds transient recovery distance inside one PRD

RESPONSIBILITY SPLIT THRESHOLD
  bounds total responsibility size
```

Recommended checkpoint triggers from the checkpoint/liveness contract remain event-driven, including approximately:

```text
>=3000 NEW substantive lines reconstructed
>=250 newly authored reviewable LOC
>=400 materially modified reviewable LOC
semantic/evidence frontier movement
pre-risk operation
```

Recommended hard checkpoint ceilings:

```text
>=500 newly authored reviewable LOC
>=700 materially modified reviewable LOC
```

These force checkpointing, not automatic creation of a new PRD.

Cumulative PRD limits such as `>20 active Coder minutes` or `>1500 reviewable semantic LOC` cause `SPLIT_REMAINDER` / `SPLIT_REQUIRED` unless an explicit governed exception applies.

Replacement executors do not reset cumulative responsibility-size usage.

## Reviewer bounded-repair envelope

To prevent a small Coder responsibility from hiding a second large implementation inside review, projects SHOULD define Reviewer repair budgets.

Recommended starting profile:

```text
TARGET: <=5 active min, <=150 reviewable LOC
HARD:   <=10 active min, <=300 reviewable LOC
```

A larger discovered repair becomes a governed material-scope change or successor repair responsibility rather than silent extended Reviewer coding.

## Parallel write-surface safety

Before releasing concurrent PRDs, the Phase Coordinator SHOULD compare declared `write_surface` values.

Conflicting write surfaces require one of:

```text
SERIALIZE
DECLARE DEPENDENCY
ISOLATE/PROVE SAFE INTEGRATION STRATEGY
```

Parallelism is permitted by independent responsibility/workspace topology, not merely by having multiple executors available.

## Deterministic phase roll-up

For a Phase:

```text
phase_D = sum(component_weight * component_delivery_fraction) / phase_weight
phase_E = sum(component_weight * component_evidenced_fraction) / phase_weight
```

`component` includes instantiated PRDs, reserve, phase-integration units and phase-qualification units.

Reserve contributes zero until legitimately allocated/dispositioned.

## Deterministic programme roll-up

For a Programme:

```text
programme_D = sum(phase_weight * phase_D) / total_programme_weight
programme_E = sum(phase_weight * phase_E) / total_programme_weight
```

Do not calculate programme progress from issue count, PR count, commit count, elapsed time, LOC, executor count, or equal-weight phase averaging unless equal weights were explicitly adopted in the manifest.

## Liveness/status is orthogonal to progress

Traffic-light status MUST NOT be inferred from percentage completion.

Recommended states remain:

```text
🟢 ACTIVE
🟡 QUIET / POSSIBLE_SPINNING
🔵 WAITING
🔴 STALE
✅ COMPLETE
```

A task may be `D15% 🟢` and healthy or `D88% 🔴` and abandoned.

Critical-path metadata SHOULD influence Phase/Programme status roll-up.

Example:

```yaml
dependency:
  from: C03
  to: C05
  class: HARD
  critical_path: true
```

Recommended aggregate severity:

```text
RED    if a critical-path PRD/Coordinator is STALE or a critical dependency is irrecoverably blocked
YELLOW if critical-path work is QUIET/SPINNING or a noncritical responsibility is STALE
BLUE   if no red/yellow exists but critical path is legitimately WAITING
GREEN  otherwise while work is active
COMPLETE only after delivery/acceptance completion semantics are satisfied
```

Do not average colors.

## Title projection

Implemented by the DELP projector (`operating-model/durable-execution-lineage-projection-v32.md`); these grammars supersede the earlier brace forms.

Responsibility (leaf) title:

```text
🟢 [#527 › #588 › #592 → PR#593] R:P60/E45 · U3 · ACTIVE — <responsibility title>
```

Phase (intermediate) title:

```text
🟡 [#527 › #588 → #592/PR#593] Φ:D43/E36 · F4 · EVIDENCE_GAP — <phase title>
```

Programme (root) title:

```text
🟡 [#527] Π:D28/E22 · F6 · EVIDENCE_GAP — <programme title>
```

Titles are disposable read models, generated from the execution graph (this manifest in machine-readable form), `CHECKPOINT_FACTS_V1` and observed material truth, never typed by an executor. The manifests/evidence are authority for reconstruction. The per-colour issue counts of the earlier form are replaced by the frontier count `F` and the derived state word; colours are still never averaged.

## Decomposition Validation Gate

Before first production release, the Coordinator SHOULD produce a machine-verifiable decomposition quality result proving at least:

```text
PROGRAMME
- parent outcome defined
- phase scope covers declared programme scope
- phase weights fully allocate denominator
- no unexplained unallocated scope

PHASE
- outcome, entrance/exit criteria and dependencies declared
- Coordinator identity declared
- phase integration/qualification budget declared
- responsibility + reserve weight conservation holds

RESPONSIBILITY
- stable PRD identity
- bounded outcome
- size-budget estimate present
- write surface declared
- acceptance profile resolvable
- semantic implementation units declared
- dependencies valid/acyclic
- parallel write collisions classified

ACCEPTANCE
- project protocol pinned
- Reviewer/Super Reviewer methods resolvable
- external gates represented where required

PROGRESS
- denominator completely allocated
- split conservation enabled
- reserve represented
- no progress from elapsed time/LOC/activity alone

OBSERVABILITY
- title projection configured
- checkpoint/liveness projection configured
- watcher availability recorded truthfully
```

Suggested result:

```text
DECOMPOSITION_QUALITY_REPORT
PLAN_STATE: RELEASEABLE | NOT_RELEASEABLE
```

## Projection engine

Percentage calculation SHOULD be deterministic code, not LLM arithmetic.

Conceptual flow:

```text
Programme manifest
+ Phase manifests
+ Responsibility blocks
+ Acceptance profiles
+ TASK_EVIDENCE/current validity
+ activity leases
+ provider state
        |
        v
progress projection engine
        |
        +-- PRD P/E/D
        +-- Phase D/E/status
        +-- Programme D/E/status
        +-- issue-title projections
        `-- managed current-state tables
```

Executors generate structured state/evidence. The projection engine generates percentages/status.

## Executor-lifetime rule

A short-lived executor epoch SHOULD normally own exactly one Production Responsibility.

```text
PRD
 -> fresh executor/context
 -> checkpoints
 -> scoped TASK_RESULT / handoff
 -> executor epoch ends
```

The Phase Coordinator remains the longer-lived contextual owner across multiple PRDs. Reusing the same underlying model is permitted, but carrying one unbounded transient executor context across multiple PRDs defeats isolation and recovery goals.

## Governing anti-drift rules

Reject or flag projections/plans that:

- let an executor manually choose P/E/D percentages;
- equate Coder P100 with Local/Phase/Programme complete;
- change percentage merely by splitting or merging work;
- omit undecomposed reserve while substantial future scope is known;
- silently expand scope without denominator change;
- derive completion from LOC/time/commits/issues/PR count;
- let replacement executors reset responsibility-size budgets;
- average traffic-light colors without critical-path semantics;
- permit Phase 100 while unresolved reserve/integration/qualification remains;
- use a 35k-line mechanical copy as ordinary semantic authored progress.
