# FURTHER_TASK_SNAPSHOT — current

`AUTHORITY: DERIVED_CONTINUITY_ONLY`

Use one mutable responsibility-scoped current-state projection. Update the same managed surface at semantic events; do not append heartbeat comments.

```

Rules:
- new continuity-managed responsibilities should record an exact successor-verifiable `PROTOCOL_REF`; missing/UNKNOWN is compatibility-only and must not be fabricated;
- `RECONCILIATION_NEEDED=true` means material/evidence state differs and should be inspected; it does **not** by itself force recovery evidence on an uninterrupted current executor;
- a successor or detected interrupted-executor recovery uses `recovery-start` / `stream-loss`, which sets a recovery `mode` and makes `recovery_evidence_required=true` until durable provider readback succeeds;
- derive Git/material facts where automation is available;
- starting implementation changes state to `IMPLEMENTING` but earns no P/E credit;
- evidence can never outrun completion;
- title P/E is a disposable mirror;
- provider update failure is observability debt only;
- no timer/heartbeat updates.
