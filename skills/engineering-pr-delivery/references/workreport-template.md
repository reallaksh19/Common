When `EXECUTION_MODE=AUTO`, also record the current approved plan boundary and any hard-stop condition using `references/auto-mode.md`.

## 2. Handover in 60 Seconds

### What is now true
### What is currently being worked on
### What remains unfinished
### What has been proven
### What has NOT been proven / NOT_RUN
### What must not be assumed
### Highest-risk remaining item
### Exact next action

## 3. Repository Ground Truth

Record live PR/main state, current changed-file count, reviews, checks, mergeability, dependencies, claims, and grounding timestamp.

## 4. Mission / Scope / Acceptance

- mission;
- engineering/user consequence;
- approved scope;
- explicit non-goals;
- acceptance criteria;
- owner instructions;
- critical constraints.

For AUTO MODE also record the approved phase plan and the explicit boundary beyond which owner authorization is required.

## 5. Current Implementation State

| Work item | Implementation | Integration | Validation | Location | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Use explicit states rather than one generic DONE.

## 6. Active Engineering Item Register

| ID | Type | Severity | Priority | Status | Summary | Evidence | Current PR? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

IDs: `ISS-*`, `IMP-*`, `RISK-*`, `DEC-*`, `QST-*`, `DEBT-*`.

## 7. Current Technical Diagnosis

```text
Observed symptom:
Current hypothesis:
Supporting evidence:
Alternative hypotheses:
Already ruled out:
Falsifier:
Next isolating experiment:
```

## 8. Authority and Invariants

Record engineering/software source-of-truth boundaries, governing references, units/sign conventions where relevant, and invariants that must remain unchanged.

## 9. Current Validation

For each material validation record:

```text
ID:
Status: PASS | FAIL | NOT_RUN | NOT_APPLICABLE
Observation: LOCAL_EXECUTION | REMOTE_EXECUTION | SOURCE_INSPECTION | ARTIFACT_INSPECTION | USER_SUPPLIED | INFERRED | NOT_OBSERVED
Oracle: NONE | IMPLEMENTATION_COUPLED | INDEPENDENT_REPRODUCTION | ANALYTICAL | AUTHORITATIVE_REFERENCE | CROSS_SOLVER | EXPERIMENTAL
Tested HEAD:
Command/evidence:
Expected:
Actual:
Limitations:
Origin: PREEXISTING | INTRODUCED_BY_PR | RESOLVED_BY_PR | UNKNOWN_ORIGIN
```

## 10. Changed-File Ledger

| File | Intended? | First stage | Latest stage | Purpose | Sensitive? | Validation |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|---|

Record actual GitHub file count, ledger count, unexplained files, and reconciliation HEAD.

## 11. Review / CI State

Open/closed review threads, requested changes, owner decisions required, checks/workflows, and exact applicability to current HEAD.

## 12. Repository Coordination / Overlap

```text
MASTER_INDEX_CHECKED:
STATUS_RECORD:
CLAIM_RECORD:
LAST_OVERLAP_CHECK:
FILE_OVERLAP:
AUTHORITY_OVERLAP:
DEPENDENCY_OVERLAP:

## 13. Continuation State

```text
Start here:
Exact file/function/component:
Current value/path under investigation:
Do not redo:
Do not change:
Validation still required:
Highest-risk remaining item:
Exact next action:
```

If AUTO MODE is active, state whether the next action is inside the approved plan and whether any hard-stop condition exists. If none exists, the next agent should continue automatically after qualifying/re-grounding as required.

## 14. Takeover / Custody Chain

Append-only `TKO-*` events and `GE-*` grounding epochs. Record inherited-and-revalidated, inherited-not-revalidated, superseded, contradicted, and newly-observed facts.

# APPENDIX A — IMPLEMENTATION TAKEOVER QUALIFICATION
