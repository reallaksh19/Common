# ChatGPT Work ↔ Local Engineering Coordinator

Use this bridge when ChatGPT Work owns programme coordination but local execution requires capabilities that Work does not directly provide.

The local engineering coordinator is **not** a second programme coordinator.

**Relay protocol rule:** if Relay material is consulted, use **V3.1 only**. V3 and V2.5 are historical/compatibility material and must not be used for live execution, coordination, recovery, gating, status or Owner-command semantics.

```

The local coordinator chooses engineering decomposition, workers, worktrees, tests and local probes.

For each substantial worker responsibility, the local coordinator should ensure the owning engineering agent has a durable child-issue `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN` when practical. The worker authors the plan; the local coordinator does not replace engineering judgement with a coordinator-written plan.

Plan publication/revision is reconstruction context, never local execution permission.

## Work → local: CONTEXT_UPDATE

## Local → Work: LOCAL_EXECUTION_EVENT

Use only when an operational event affects programme coordination.

Good example:

```text
Worker session died.
Useful material is durable at <ref>.
Replacement worker is continuing.
No programme consequence.
```

Do not promote routine chatter:

- worker started;
- worker thinking;
- browser opened;
- test still running;
- worker idle;
- retrying command.

## Evidence promotion

Local evidence can remain `LOCAL_ONLY` while it matters only to local engineering.

Promote to `SHARED_DURABLE` when it:

- changes another workstream;
- changes a durable interface/contract;
- changes an Owner decision;
- is required for zero-context consumer reconstruction.

Promotion means persisting the useful conclusion/evidence locator in a shared durable surface such as an issue, PR, test artifact or repository file. It does not mean copying all local logs into GitHub.
