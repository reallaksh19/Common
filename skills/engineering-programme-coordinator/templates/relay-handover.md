# [Relay Handover] Programme Operational Ledger

This child issue is the durable **current operational index** for one programme.

It is continuously useful during multi-agent execution, not only when a human/agent hands over.

It is an index to durable evidence, not the engineering truth itself.

PARENT_PROGRAMME: github:<owner>/<repo>#<parent>
PROGRAMME_BASIS_REVISION: PB-....
RELAY_PROTOCOL: V3.1_ONLY
```

## Non-authority rule

Missing, stale or incorrect Handover content may reduce observability/reconstruction quality.

It does **not** invalidate production work, revoke ownership, block coding, block PRs or authorize execution.

A ledger statement such as "B produced X" is not proof by itself. Link the commit/PR/test/artifact that proves X.

### <A> — <child issue>

**Owned outcome:** ...

**Implementation plan:** PRESENT / MISSING / STALE / UNKNOWN — <ref/revision>

**Plan responsibility basis:** <child issue/provider ref + body/contract digest when available>

**Agent / local coordinator ref:** ...

**Provider issue state:** OPEN / CLOSED / UNKNOWN

**Branch:** ...

**PR:** ...

**Base:** ...

**Exact head:** ...

**Task Snapshot:** <ref>

**Responsibility state:** COMPLETE / PARTIAL / OPEN / NOT_RUN / UNKNOWN

**Child acceptance:** SATISFIED / PARTIAL / OPEN / UNKNOWN — <coverage or UNKNOWN>

**Programme contribution:** SATISFIED / PARTIAL / OPEN / UNKNOWN — <coverage or UNKNOWN>

**Verification:** PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL / NOT_RUN / PENDING / UNKNOWN — <failure origins>

**Delivery:** NONE / DRAFT / OPEN / REVIEW_READY / CHANGES_REQUESTED / CONFLICTED / MERGED / CLOSED / UNKNOWN

**What remains:**

**Expected next observable:** ...

**Latest task publications:**

- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN / PLAN_UPDATE / TASK_EVIDENCE / TASK_RESULT refs only

**Latest durable evidence:**

- ...

**Next programme consequence:** ...

Repeat for every active/nonterminal workstream, and retain recently completed workstreams while their result still has an unresolved consumer/programme consequence. Provider issue state and responsibility state are independent; an OPEN issue may already have a completed responsibility.

## Dependency ledger

| Producer | Required production output | Consumer | State | Evidence | Independent work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B | ... | C | MISSING / UNCERTAIN / DISCOVERED / SATISFIED / SUPERSEDED | ... | ... |

Do not represent dependencies as permission locks.

## Nonterminal PRs

Carry every nonterminal PR until it is merged, closed or superseded.

| PR | Workstream | Lifecycle | Head | Base | Mergeability / review | Note |

## Local engineering coordination

Promote only programme-significant local results:

- durable result;
- discovered production dependency;
- semantic change;
- local evidence requiring shared promotion;
- session loss with material programme consequence.

Do not copy routine worker chatter or command logs here.

## Owner decisions needed

Prefer:

```text
NONE
```

When needed, state the exact decision, why it belongs to the Owner, affected workstreams, evidence and reversible consequences.

## Next coordinator action

What is the smallest useful coordination move now?

Examples:

- route B's durable output to C;
- send a CONTEXT_UPDATE to local coordinator;
- observe an expected PR result later;
- reconcile a semantic change;
- ask Owner one genuine question;
- do nothing.

A timer/event may be used to wake this observation, but the timer is never authority.
