# Primary Teacher Runtime Skill

## Mandatory references

Always load and follow:

- `../../Primary/Architecture/PRIMARY_INTEGRATED_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `../../Primary/Architecture/PRIMARY_TEACHER_RUNTIME.md`
- `../../Primary/Architecture/PRIMARY_DIAGNOSTIC_REASONING.md`
- `../../Primary/Architecture/SEMANTIC_OWNERSHIP.md`

Then load the relevant subject schema/skill. This skill does not replace Math or English pedagogy.

When the task includes Grade 4–5 mathematical notebook/classwork, handwritten intermediate work, operation-selection evidence, grouped units/rates, or multi-step working that can change the diagnosis, also load:

- `../../Primary/Architecture/PRIMARY_MATH_WORK_EVIDENCE.md`

## When to use

Use for interactive Grade 4–5 teaching, adaptive tutoring, diagnostic repair, learner-response analysis, scaffold selection/fading, or when a child is repeatedly asking for clarification.

Do not force this runtime into passive reference-material tasks when the user explicitly asks only for notes, a worksheet, or a static study guide.

## Runtime loop

```text
OBSERVATION
→ RESPONSE DIAGNOSIS
→ TEACHER DECISION
→ TEACHER MOVE
→ CHILD ACTION
→ NEW EVIDENCE
↺
```

When more than one explanation is plausible, use the stricter diagnostic loop:

```text
OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE
→ STRUCTURAL FEATURES / CONTRAST SET
→ 2–3 BOUNDED HYPOTHESES
→ DIAGNOSTIC PROBE
→ OBSERVED PROBE RESULT
→ CONFIDENCE UPDATE
→ TEACHER DECISION
→ TEACHER MOVE
→ INDEPENDENT RETRY
```

When intermediate mathematical work is available, preserve it before diagnosis:

```text
CHILD WORK
→ MATHEMATICAL WORK EVIDENCE
→ ERROR SIGNATURE / STRUCTURAL PATTERN
→ BOUNDED RESPONSE DIAGNOSIS
→ SMALLEST DISCRIMINATING PROBE
→ TEACHER MOVE
→ INDEPENDENT RETRY
```

A diagnosis is a hypothesis, not a child label.

## Required distinctions

Keep these separate:

```text
long-lived SkillState ≠ CurrentLearningState
raw evidence ≠ pedagogical judgement
conceptual support ≠ access/load adjustment
provided representation ≠ child-selected ≠ child-produced
child-produced strategy support ≠ child-initiated strategy
child-produced strategy support ≠ teacher-provided hint
child work ≠ teacher annotation/correction
error signature ≠ durable learner trait
contrast set ≠ arbitrary pattern matching
diagnostic probe ≠ extra practice question
acquisition ≠ independent use ≠ delayed retention ≠ transfer ≠ stretch
```

`CHILD_PRODUCED` records who physically produced a representation or strategy support. It does not prove independent strategy selection. Preserve strategy initiation separately when observable: actor + mode (`SPONTANEOUS`, `GENERAL_PROMPT`, `STRATEGY_PROMPT`, `EXPLICIT_DIRECTION`, `UNKNOWN`).

## Smallest useful move

Prefer the smallest teacher move that makes the child do the next piece of thinking.

Do not answer a repeated clarification with only a label or conclusion when the learner needs a reusable recognition cue.

Example:

```text
Child: "Large?"

Better:
"Large tells us how big something is. Words that tell how big go in SIZE. Now try: where would tiny go?"
```

This answers, teaches the cue, and checks transfer.

## Diagnostic probe rule

When multiple explanations are plausible, do not jump directly from evidence to a confident diagnosis.

Maintain 2–3 bounded hypotheses and choose a probe that states:

```text
which hypotheses it discriminates
which feature it manipulates
which unrelated loads it keeps low
how major outcomes update confidence
```

Prefer controlled one-step probes, partial completions, small prerequisite checks, or example/non-example pairs over harder or longer practice.

A diagnostic probe is for information gain, not challenge.

## Contrast-set rule

Contrast-based diagnosis must be deliberate.

A valid contrast set identifies:

```text
focal diagnostic feature
shared background structure
cases where the focal feature is present/absent or otherwise deliberately varied
```

Do not let the runtime infer an arbitrary correlation simply because several attempts are available.

## Same-route failure

If the child has two unsuccessful attempts on the same target with substantially the same teaching route, the next move must change a meaningful dimension:

- representation;
- language load;
- concrete context;
- task size;
- response mode;
- problem structure;
- prerequisite probe;
- example/non-example contrast.

Do not repeat the same explanation at greater length.

## Child action

In tutor mode, substantial teaching should normally be followed by observable child action such as classifying, showing, choosing, explaining, completing one step, or solving a near-isomorphic retry.

## Conceptual support and access support

Conceptual help may use subject-specific H-levels and moves such as prompt, hint, model, think-aloud, or worked example.

Access adjustments may include reduced language, one-step-at-a-time instructions, oral response, reduced writing, read-aloud support, or additional visual spacing.

Do not record an access adjustment as conceptual hint dependence.

## Mathematical work evidence

When intermediate Math work exists, do not reduce it to final correctness.

Preserve where observable:

```text
operation selected
ordered work steps
successful substeps
incorrect substeps
quantity/unit relationships
representations
child-generated strategy supports
strategy initiation when observable
self-corrections
step-level provenance/certainty where useful
teacher annotations with separate provenance
```

Use `PRIMARY_MATH_WORK_EVIDENCE.md` for Math evidence semantics and `PRIMARY_DIAGNOSTIC_REASONING.md` for diagnostic comparison/probe semantics.

Important rules:

- an incorrect final answer does not erase correct intermediate reasoning;
- a child-produced multiplication/multiples table can be positive strategic evidence;
- a child-produced table after explicit teacher direction is not equivalent to spontaneous strategy selection;
- teacher-written corrections are not independent child evidence;
- ambiguous handwriting remains `AMBIGUOUS`/`NOT_OBSERVED` rather than being invented;
- preserve provenance at mathematically meaningful work-step level when it affects independence or diagnosis;
- if several structurally related items exist, compare them through an explicit focal feature before concluding the whole topic is weak;
- for word problems with grouped units, rates, money or conversion, inspect `QUANTITY → UNIT → ROLE → RELATIONSHIP → UNKNOWN → OPERATION(S)` before teaching from keywords.

## Error handling

Wrong answer does not automatically mean reteach.

Consider at least:

```text
CONCEPTUAL_MISCONCEPTION
PREREQUISITE_GAP
PROCEDURAL_ERROR
LANGUAGE_COMPREHENSION_ERROR
REPRESENTATION_ERROR
TASK_INTERPRETATION_ERROR
MEMORY_RETRIEVAL_FAILURE
PERFORMANCE_LAPSE
ATTENTION_OR_RUSHING_CANDIDATE
RESPONSE_FORM_ERROR
SOURCE_MODEL_BOUNDARY
INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE
```

Subject-specific error signatures may narrow a generic diagnosis, but remain evidence patterns rather than durable learner traits.

For example:

```text
PROCEDURAL_ERROR + DIV_QUOTIENT_ZERO_PLACE_VALUE
```

may be a better bounded hypothesis than `weak in division` when controlled contrast evidence supports it.

When multiple explanations are plausible, ask the smallest diagnostic question that separates them and interpret the result against the competing hypotheses.

## Evidence-family boundary

Not every renderer observes the same evidence.

```text
LearningEvidence
  |- AttemptEvidence
  |- MathematicalWorkEvidence
  |- OralResponseEvidence
  |- TeacherObservationEvidence
```

Do not require a game renderer to invent intermediate work it cannot observe. Use only evidence the renderer can faithfully capture or transport.

## Repair and retry

After meaningful conceptual repair, give an independent retry on an isomorphic or appropriately varied item before treating the skill as independently available.

Worked-example success is not independent evidence.

## Support fading

When evidence permits, reduce help by removing conceptual hints, reducing provided structure, asking the learner to select/produce a representation, or moving to transfer.

## Source-model boundary

If a child's textbook teaches a simplified rule, preserve that rule. If an example falls outside its taxonomy, mark the boundary rather than inventing a new child-facing category.

Keep fuller canonical analysis separate from the source model.

## Feedback policy

- preserve the correct part of the child's thinking;
- identify one useful next action;
- use child-friendly language;
- avoid fixed-ability labels;
- avoid long lectures immediately after errors;
- give a reusable cue or method, not only the answer;
- keep mistakes safe to reveal.

## Stop rule

End, defer, or change the activity when the target evidence has been obtained, repetition adds little value, a different prerequisite episode is needed, source ambiguity blocks reliable teaching, or current session signals indicate that continuing is not useful.

## Mastery evidence

Never infer durable mastery from one session or one game score.

Track relevant evidence separately for:

```text
ACQUISITION
INDEPENDENT_USE
DELAYED_RETENTION
TRANSFER
STRETCH (optional)
```

Competition preparation belongs primarily to stretch/assessment-demand extensions and must not redefine ordinary curriculum mastery.
