# Durable Execution Lineage and Projection (DELP) — V3.5

Status: **normative for V3.5**, implemented by `scripts/delp_projection_v35.py`, validated by `schemas/delp-*-v35.schema.yaml` and pinned by `tests/test_delp_projection_v35.py`. The same contract is applied to the frozen-by-default V3.2 line as `scripts/delp_projection_v32.py` under an explicit Owner amendment (see [Amendment of V3.2](#amendment-of-v32)).

## The rule

> **Agents publish facts. Everything else is recomputed from those facts.**
>
> An agent states, about its own leaf responsibility only: which declared units it reports complete, the verification result, the durable evidence refs, the candidate those refs cover, and the next unit. It never writes a percentage, a title, a weight, a frontier count, an activity epoch, an evidence-health verdict or any parent/programme number. Those are projections; the DELP projector derives them, and any facts record that tries to author one is **rejected and cannot move any number**.

This is not a title-formatting rule. It is an execution identity, lineage, evidence, projection and concurrency rule: a fresh or interrupted executor must be able to answer *what exactly am I working on, which parent does it belong to, which PR and candidate does the latest evidence cover, how complete is it, is that progress actually evidenced, and what happens next* from durable truth, never from conversation memory.

## Three authorities (never merged)

```text
PROGRAMME AUTHORITY   Human Owner / explicitly delegated programme authority
                      -> owns scope, priority, the execution graph (plan) and its denominators
EXECUTION CUSTODY     the agent currently performing ONE bounded leaf responsibility
                      -> owns facts about that leaf, nothing above it
STATUS PROJECTION     deterministic reconstruction from graph + facts + observed material truth
                      -> owns no engineering authority; disposable and rebuildable
```

A parent issue needs no permanently assigned agent. A projection never grants permission. An agent never owns programme truth.

## What an agent publishes — `CHECKPOINT_FACTS_V1`

Inside a `TASK_EVIDENCE` comment (the publication family is unchanged; this is the machine-readable core of the existing `TASK_EVIDENCE — CHECKPOINT`), one fenced YAML block:

````text
TASK_EVIDENCE — CHECKPOINT

<free prose for humans: claim, consequence, negative knowledge ...>

```yaml
CHECKPOINT_FACTS_V1:
  responsibility: {issue: Common#592, id: P3-I-R2}
  material: {pr: Common#593, candidate_sha: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567}
  units:
    - id: U04
      state: COMPLETE                    # COMPLETE | IN_PROGRESS | NOT_STARTED
      result: VERIFIED                   # VERIFIED | PARTIAL | FAILED | NOT_RUN | PENDING
      evidence_refs: [Common#592#issuecomment-12345]
  next: {unit: U05, action: negative replay}
  blocker: NONE
  owner_action: NONE
```
````

Allowed fields: `responsibility`, `material`, `units[]` (`id`, `state`, `result`, `evidence_refs`, optional `candidate_sha`, `contract_digest`), `gates[]` (reviewer/super-reviewer delivery gates: `id`, `result`, `evidence_refs`), `activity` (`ACTIVE`, `WAITING_CI`, `WAITING_TOOL`, `WAITING_EXTERNAL`, `WAITING_PROVIDER_VISIBILITY`, `RECOVERING`, `PAUSED`), `next`, `blocker`, `owner_action`, `result` (scope + `responsibility_complete`, optional `superseded_by`).

**Rejected, recursively, at any depth:** `progress`, `percent`, `p`/`e`/`d`, `title`, `parent_progress`, `programme_progress`, `frontier(_count)`, `activity_epoch`, `evidence_health`, `projection`, `light`, `denominator`, `weight(s)`, `reserve(_weight)`, `evidenced`, and any string that contains projection notation (`R:P…/E…`, `Φ:D…/E…`, `Π:D…/E…`, `{P…% · E…%`). `QUIET` and `STALE` can never be declared: a dead executor cannot report its own death, so liveness comes only from an external observer. Weights are plan authority and live only in the execution graph.

`python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py validate-facts <file>` exits non-zero on any violation. The projector applies the same validation to every ledger record: an invalid record is listed under `rejected_facts` and contributes nothing.

**Who may publish facts.** Anyone can comment on a public issue, so `sync-github` believes a facts block only from a trusted author: an explicit `programme.fact_authors` login list in the execution graph, or, when absent, a repository `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`. A block from anyone else is kept in the ledger, rejected with `author … is not a trusted fact author` and counted nowhere. Facts must also name a declared **leaf** (and the planned `responsibility_id` when both exist); a record for a parent issue or an unknown issue is rejected.

## The execution graph (plan authority)

```yaml
schema: relay-v3.5-delp-execution-graph
programme: {id: COMMON-PROD-CONTROL-V1, root: Common#527}
nodes:
  - {ref: Common#527, kind: ROOT}
  - {ref: Common#588, kind: INTERMEDIATE, parent: Common#527, weight: 3}
  - ref: Common#592
    kind: LEAF
    parent: Common#588
    weight: 3
    responsibility_id: P3-I-R2
    primary_pr: Common#593          # or candidate_ref: <branch> while there is no PR
    critical: true
    units: [{id: U01, weight: 20}, {id: U02, weight: 30}, {id: U03, weight: 25}, {id: U04, weight: 25}]
```

- Lineage and denominators are typed and explicit; nothing is inferred from titles or free-text "related" lists.
- **Parent issues are not execution workspaces.** Material work is a `LEAF`; a facts record addressed to a non-leaf issue is rejected.
- A split conserves weight; progressive decomposition consumes an explicit `reserve_weight`, which counts as zero progress and blocks `COMPLETE`; true scope expansion changes the denominator by editing the graph (record it as `PLAN_UPDATE — SCOPE_EXPANSION`). A percentage may legitimately fall; the projector never renormalises to preserve one.
- `delivery_gates` (+ `coder_weight`, default 60 when gates exist) keep Coder `P100` from meaning delivery `D100`: reviewer acceptance, super review and final hand-off add delivery weight only with their own current evidence.
- A leaf also carries its **decomposition contract** (`outcome`, `size_budget`, `write_surface`, `depends_on`, a `verify` step per unit). The progress maths never reads it; the [decomposition gate](#decomposition-gate--small-verifiable-collision-free-leaves) judges it.

## How numbers are computed

```text
leaf P  = Σ weight(units whose latest claim is COMPLETE)            / Σ weight(units)
leaf E  = Σ weight(COMPLETE units with CURRENT evidence)            / Σ weight(units)      (E <= P by construction)
leaf D  = (coder_weight·P  + Σ weight(gates PASSED))                / (coder_weight + Σ weight(gates))
leaf DE = (coder_weight·E  + Σ weight(gates PASSED with current evidence)) / same denominator
node  D = Σ(wᵢ · Dᵢ) / (Σ wᵢ + reserve)       node E = Σ(wᵢ · DEᵢ) / (Σ wᵢ + reserve)       (recomputed, never incremented)
```

`CURRENT evidence` for a unit means *all* of: latest claim is `COMPLETE`; `result` is in the leaf's accepted verification set (default `VERIFIED`); at least one evidence ref; the claim's `candidate_sha` **equals the live candidate** (primary PR head, or `candidate_ref` head); the claim names the planned PR; and, when the graph pins one, the `contract_digest` matches. Otherwise the unit is a visible gap with a named reason (`NO_EVIDENCE_REFS`, `RESULT_NOT_ACCEPTED(x)`, `CANDIDATE_MISMATCH`, `CANDIDATE_UNOBSERVED`, `PR_MISMATCH`, `CONTRACT_DIGEST_MISMATCH`). A moved candidate therefore lowers `E` without touching `P`, until the evidence is replayed on the new head — evidence for an older candidate never silently certifies the new one. An unobservable candidate is treated conservatively by the pure engine (`UNVERIFIABLE`, `E` not counted), but `sync-github` aborts the whole pass — no writes, non-zero exit — when a live candidate cannot be read, so a provider outage never publishes a misleading drop.

Display percent is exact-rational → half-up, and never shows `100` unless exactly full or `0` unless exactly empty. Exact ratios (`"9/16"`) are kept in the projection for audit.

Evidence health: `CURRENT`, `GAP`, `STALE_CANDIDATE`, `UNVERIFIABLE`. Complete is earned only when the leaf result says `RESPONSIBILITY`/`YES`, every unit is complete **with current evidence**, and every delivery gate is passed **with current evidence**; a premature `YES` is ignored and flagged (`RESULT_CLAIMS_COMPLETE_BUT_UNITS_OPEN`, `COMPLETE_CLAIM_WITHOUT_CURRENT_EVIDENCE`, `COMPLETE_CLAIM_WITH_OPEN_DELIVERY_GATES`, `COMPLETE_CLAIM_WITH_UNEVIDENCED_DELIVERY_GATES`). `activity`, `next`, `blocker` and `owner_action` take the most recent *stated* value, so a reviewer's gates-only record never resets the Coder's blocker or next unit.

## Title grammar (generated; never authored)

```text
leaf          🟢 [#527 › #588 › #592 → PR#593] R:P65/E65 · U04 · ACTIVE — <responsibility>
intermediate  🟢 [#527 › #588 → #592/PR#593] Φ:D60/E58 · F2 · ACTIVE — <phase>
programme     🟢 [#527] Π:D72/E70 · F3 · ACTIVE — <programme>
```

`›` is ownership/hierarchy; `→` is the material PR relation (a PR is not another programme child). `P`/`D` are semantic/delivery progress, `E` is the evidenced part of it, `F` is the number of active frontier leaves under the node. The scope letter is mandatory: a bare `P56% / E56%` is invalid. Active-unit token: the agent's `next.unit` if it names a declared incomplete unit, otherwise the first incomplete unit.

State words → light: `ACTIVE 🟢`; `WAITING_* / WAITING 🔵`; `UNMATERIALIZED`, `EVIDENCE_GAP`, `EVIDENCE_STALE`, `QUIET`, `RECOVERING`, `NOT_RELEASEABLE`, `PLAN_GAP 🟡`; `STALE 🔴`; `COMPLETE ✅`; `NOT_STARTED`, `PAUSED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `IDLE ⚪`. Ancestor state is derived from the subtree without averaging colours: red if a `critical` leaf is stale; yellow for any unmaterialized leaf, any evidence gap/stale, critical quiet/recovering or non-critical stale; blue if only critical work is waiting; green while frontier work is active; `PLAN_GAP` (yellow) only when the decomposition gate is `ENFORCED`, nothing is active and a leaf below fails the gate; `COMPLETE` only when every leaf is terminal, delivery is 100 and no reserve remains.

The human part (`— <responsibility>`) is the only thing an agent or Owner edits. The projector splits an existing title into generated prefix + base, recognising the legacy forms `🟢 {P42% · E31% · A07 · U03 · ACTIVE} <title>` and `<title> {P50% · E50% · UNIT-02 · IMPLEMENTING}`, so migration is automatic at the next pass. Titles are capped at 250 characters by truncating the human base, never the projection. `A<n>` (activity epoch) is no longer in the title; it is `activity_epoch` in `LIVE_STATUS_V1`.

**Drift correction.** GitHub cannot stop a hand edit, so DELP makes it non-authoritative and self-healing: every pass recomputes the expected title; a differing title is classified (`STALE_OR_HAND_EDITED`, `MISSING_PROJECTION`, `LEGACY_FORMAT`), rewritten, and the write reports `title_corrected: true`. `verify-titles` exits `2` when any title drifted.

## Worked lifecycle (pinned by `test_documented_lifecycle_walkthrough`)

Graph: programme #527 → phase #588 (weight 3: leaf #592 weight 3 with units 20/30/25/25 and PR #593; leaf #594 weight 1) and phase #610 (weight 1). Only #592 is shown; #594 and #610 are untouched.

| Test rerun, nothing changed | – | unchanged | unchanged | unchanged (same `input_digest` ⇒ no write) |

## `LIVE_STATUS_V1` and compare-and-swap

Each node has one managed comment (`<!-- relay-delp:live-status:start -->`) carrying a JSON document and a marker `<!-- relay-delp:version=N digest=sha256:… -->`. The document is derived, disposable, never edited by agents, and valid against `schemas/delp-live-status-v35.schema.yaml` (identity/lineage, material, execution state, evidence health and gaps, progress, frontier, `activity_epoch`, `next`, `blocker`, `owner_action`, warnings, `projection.version`, `projection.input_digest`).

Writes are **not last-writer-wins**. The writer reads version *N*, recomputes, and writes *N+1* only if the surface still shows *N*; it re-reads before writing, writes, then reads back version and digest. A lost race (stale expected version, or a readback that shows another writer's version) raises `ProjectionConflict`; the caller drops cached inputs, recomputes from fresh truth and retries (bounded). Identical `input_digest` and title ⇒ `UNCHANGED`, no write. GitHub offers no conditional comment/title update, so this is detect-and-retry; because a projection is a pure function of durable inputs, a retried write converges to the same value. Provider failure is observability debt only and never blocks engineering.

## Continuation admission

`continue`, `proceed`, `next`, `resume`, `reconcile`, `take over`, `keep going` are classified by `owner_commands.py` as `CONTINUE_RECONCILE` (and `Proceed next …` workflows gain the same barrier). They mean *reconstruct and reconcile before continuing*:

```text
resolve leaf -> resolve lineage -> observe live candidate -> read latest valid facts -> compare evidence frontier
 -> repair any evidence gap FIRST -> reproject -> compare-and-swap + read back -> compact checkpoint -> execute exactly the next bounded unit
```

```text
python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py admit --graph graph.yaml --facts facts.md --observations obs.json --leaf Common#592 --command continue
```

```text
CONTINUE CHECKPOINT

PATH: #527 → #588 → #592 → PR#593
CHILD: R:P75/E75 · U04 · ACTIVE
EVIDENCE: CURRENT @ aaaaaaa
PARENT: #588 Φ:D56/E56
ROOT: #527 Π:D42/E42
BLOCKER: NONE
OWNER_ACTION: NONE
NEXT: U04 — negative replay
```

With a gap the barrier forces recovery first (`NEXT: RECOVER_EVIDENCE before new coding — U03:NO_EVIDENCE_REFS`, `recovery_required: true`). When the provider shows work for the leaf but the ledger has no accepted facts, the barrier answers `MATERIALIZE_FACTS` first (see [Materialization](#materialization--unknown-is-not-zero)); a failing plan is reported alongside it. Otherwise, when the decomposition gate is `ENFORCED` and the leaf's plan fails it, the barrier answers `FIX_PLAN` before anything else (see [the gate](#decomposition-gate--small-verifiable-collision-free-leaves)); an evidence gap is still reported alongside it. Admission is pure: `authority_effects` is always empty — a continuation never changes the parent, denominator, scope, priority or merge authority; a genuine priority change is an explicit custody transition (`PAUSED` at an exact durable frontier, successor `ACTIVE` after fresh reconstruction).

## Materialization — unknown is not zero

Progress is derived from facts, so a programme that already has history but no facts ledger would project **0%**: `P` and `E` count only what an agent has reported, and nothing has been reported. That is the wrong message. A merged pull request is provider truth that work exists; reading it as "nothing started" is a confident error, and worse than the hand-kept number it replaces.

DELP therefore separates *no work* from *work the ledger lacks*, using only what the provider shows (never what an agent says). A leaf with **no accepted facts** and a provider-observed signal is `UNMATERIALIZED` 🟡:

| Provider signal (observation) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pr_state` `OPEN` / `MERGED` / `CLOSED` | a pull request exists for the leaf (`PR_OPEN`, `PR_MERGED`, `PR_CLOSED`) |
| `ahead_by` > 0 | the leaf's `candidate_ref` branch has commits beyond `programme.base_ref` (default `main`) (`BRANCH_AHEAD_<n>`); `sync-github` reads it from the compare API |

An observed head alone is **not** a signal (a fresh branch points at its base), and with no observation at all a leaf stays `NOT_STARTED`: nothing shows otherwise.

- **Leaf:** `state UNMATERIALIZED`, `NO_ACTIVE_UNIT` (no fact says what is next), `materialization: {status, provider_signal}` in `LIVE_STATUS_V1`, warning `UNMATERIALIZED:<signal>`. It is not on the frontier. `STALE` (an observed dead executor) still outranks it.
- **Ancestors:** `UNMATERIALIZED` outranks every state except a critical `STALE` (it sits above `EVIDENCE_GAP`): the roll-up cannot see the work the ledger lacks, so its `D/E` are a **lower bound** and the title says so, e.g. `🟡 [#527] Π:D17/E17 · F0 · UNMATERIALIZED`. The numbers themselves are never inflated or invented.
- **Admission:** `MATERIALIZE_FACTS` — `EVIDENCE: NONE — no accepted facts; provider shows PR_MERGED`, `NEXT: MATERIALIZE_FACTS before any new work … publish facts for exactly what current evidence supports (completion is never inferred)`. It clears the moment an accepted facts record exists. A failing decomposition plan is reported alongside but does not come first: an agent can publish facts at once, while a plan fix needs the Coordinator.
- A leaf stops being unmaterialized by publishing facts (a merged pull request becomes `COMPLETE` through the ordinary rule: units complete with current evidence on the PR head, and a `RESPONSIBILITY`/`YES` result). Nothing about merge state alone ever completes a leaf.

**Adopting DELP on a programme with history.** Author the execution graph; run `project` or `sync-github --dry-run` (read-only) and expect `UNMATERIALIZED` on every leaf that has history and on every ancestor; publish facts leaf by leaf for what the existing evidence supports; run a live `sync-github` only when the roll-up reads the way you expect. Programme work that is not in the graph yet belongs in `reserve_weight`, which counts as zero and is reported (`UNDECOMPOSED_RESERVE`): a graph that holds only Phase 3 of a ten-thousand-point programme shows the graph's lower bound, not the programme's. `templates/checkpoint-facts-v35.md` asks for a first facts block at START so that a new leaf is never unmaterialized from its first commit.

**A plan can only be applied where it belongs.** Issue numbers are not globally unique, and the shipped examples deliberately reuse numbers that exist in real repositories. A live `sync-github` therefore requires `programme.repository` and refuses when it differs from `--repository` (a dry run may omit it but is refused on a mismatch); the shipped example declares `example/delp-demo`, so it can never be applied to a real repository.

Pinned by `RealScenarioReplay`, which replays the #527 / P3-I situation (the real issue and PR numbers, merge commits, branch head and ahead-9 / behind-4 divergence; the closed weights and the 10000 denominator) through the projector.

## Frontier — what a handover may carry, and how a successor checks it is still true

A handover is the predecessor's view of a leaf **at one instant**, never current truth. Written by hand it carries numbers (a base commit, a branch head, "ahead 9 / behind 4", a percentage) that nothing can check, and the successor is told to re-read them all. DELP derives that view and checks it mechanically.

```text
python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py frontier --graph G (--facts F --observations O | --repository owner/repo) --leaf L [--text] [--output snapshot.json]
python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py frontier-verify --snapshot snapshot.json --graph G (--facts F --observations O | --repository owner/repo) --leaf L   # exit 2 when any input moved
```

`frontier` emits `observed` (provider truth: the base head, the candidate head, `pr_state`, `ahead_by` / `behind_by`, observed liveness), `derived` (state, exact `P/E/D/DE` ratios, evidence health and gaps, active unit, plan verdict, materialization) and `inputs` (the plan digest, and the count and content digest of the leaf's accepted facts), bound by a `frontier_digest`. It contains nothing an agent authored, so there is no number to hand-compute and nothing to mistrust. `--repository` observes live and read-only (the repository guard applies); without it the inputs come from files.

`frontier-verify` recomputes the frontier now and compares:

- **`moved`** names the *inputs* that changed since the snapshot — `BASE`, `CANDIDATE_HEAD`, `PR_STATE`, `LIVENESS`, `FACTS`, `PLAN`. Any of them means the handed-over values are stale: status `MOVED`, action `RECONCILE`, exit 2. An input the predecessor never observed counts as moved once it is observed (`was: null`): unobserved is not unchanged.
- **`changed`** lists derived consequences (`STATE`, `EVIDENCE_HEALTH`, `PROGRESS_P`, `PROGRESS_E`, `ACTIVE_UNIT`). It is information, not a verdict.

Worked example, from the real event (pinned by `FrontierSnapshotAndDrift`): the P3-I handover pinned `main` at `4acc570`; the next merge moved it to `46916f4`. Verifying that handover reports exactly `MOVED BASE: 4acc570 -> 46916f4`, `changed: []`, `ACTION: RECONCILE` — the handover's own "if main moved again, stop and recompute" rule, now a check. A moved candidate head is a different case: it also changes `STATE` to `EVIDENCE_STALE` and `E` to `0/1` until the evidence is replayed, by the ordinary evidence rule.

Every `CONTINUE CHECKPOINT` carries the same material in one `FRONTIER:` line (`base 4acc570 · candidate ff7c3b7 · ahead 9 · behind 4`) whenever the provider fields were observed, so the checkpoint replaces the prose.

The frontier is not a new authority and not a handover package: it is the derived part a handover (or the `HANDOVER_PACKAGE` that #570 specifies) can embed and cite by digest. `MOVED` says *recompute*; it does not say the move matters. Whether main's change touches the leaf's write surface or the blobs its evidence depends on is a separate check.

## Agent health — observed or derived, never declared

Task evidence can show a measure of how healthy the current execution is, under one rule: **health is observed or derived, never self-declared.** A dead or looping executor cannot report that, and "I am healthy" is the easiest claim to game; this is the same reason `QUIET` and `STALE` can only come from an observer.

It is **advisory delivery-continuity telemetry**: how far a successor would have to reconstruct if this executor stopped now. It never moves a percentage, a state, a title or an admission answer, and never blocks work. The words describe continuity risk, not the quality of anyone's work, and they follow the 3-pass doctrine on repository telemetry: line counts, divergence and run counts may *locate evidence and constrain delivery*; they never establish value, quality or capability.

Opt in with `programme.health_policy.mode: ADVISORY` (default `OFF`, which adds nothing). Seven components, each `OK` / `WATCH` / `AT_RISK` / `UNOBSERVED`; the verdict is the **worst component, never an average**, and `UNOBSERVED` (nothing was observed) is never read as healthy:

| Component | Source | `WATCH` | `AT_RISK` | `UNOBSERVED` when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `materialization` | derived (ledger + provider) | — | no accepted facts but the provider shows work | — |
| `evidence` | derived (evidence health) | `GAP` | `STALE_CANDIDATE` | `UNVERIFIABLE` (head not observed) or no facts to qualify |
| `checkpoint_distance` | observed `since_checkpoint` (lines authored since the last accepted facts) | ≥ 250 added or ≥ 400 changed | ≥ 500 added or ≥ 700 changed (the written hard ceilings) | not observed; with nothing ever checkpointed the whole branch is the distance |
| `size` | observed `additions` + `deletions` against the leaf's declared `size_budget`, else the policy default | over target (700) | over hard (1500) | not observed |
| `base_drift` | observed `behind_by` | ≥ 1 commit behind | ≥ 20 behind | not observed |
| `interruptions` | operator-observed stream losses in this executor lifecycle | 1–2 | ≥ 3 (the written rule plans a handover at the third) | no losses recorded and nobody declared when watching began (zero needs an observer) |
| `liveness` | observed liveness | `QUIET` | `STALE` | no observer reported it |

Every threshold is the programme's own written rule and every one can be overridden in `health_policy`; **elapsed time alone is deliberately not a rule** (the checkpoint contract says it does not renew meaningful activity). A started, unfinished leaf gets a `health` block in `LIVE_STATUS_V1`; ancestors carry a roll-up (worst verdict, counts, the at-risk leaves); every `CONTINUE CHECKPOINT` gains one line, e.g. `HEALTH: 🔴 AT_RISK (advisory) — checkpoint_distance (2422 lines authored …); materialization (…); size (…); +4 more`; `health --graph G --facts F --observations O [--leaf L] [--json]` prints the table and always exits 0. Titles never change.

**Who supplies what.** `materialization`, `evidence` and the verdict are derived from the graph and the ledger. `sync-github` currently observes `base_sha` and `pr_state` for every leaf with a pull request and `base_sha`, `ahead_by` and `behind_by` for branch-only leaves (so `base_drift` is `UNOBSERVED` for a pull-request leaf); the diff-size observations (`additions`, `deletions`, `since_checkpoint`) and the operator's `liveness` and `interruptions` come from the observations file until an observer produces them — **until then those components read `UNOBSERVED`, which is the honest answer rather than a green one.** `interruptions` is the operator's `AGENT_OBSERVATION_V1` record — `{coverage_from, losses[]}` for the current executor lifecycle, where a successor lifecycle starts a fresh list — and an agent must not author it. One GitHub identity may post both an agent's facts and an operator's observations, so this record is only as good as that discipline; that is a second reason health is advisory and gates nothing.

Worked example from the real P3-I record (pinned by `AgentHealth`): the nine commits added 190, 282, 290, 504, 2232, 2233, 2330, 2357 and 2424 cumulative lines between 23:01:10 and 23:10:21. The measured checkpoint distance reads `OK`, `WATCH` at the second commit (23:01:15) and `AT_RISK` at the fourth (23:01:23, 504 lines, the written hard ceiling), **11 minutes 26 seconds before** the first checkpoint comment (23:12:49) — the written rule, now measured instead of remembered. At the handover the leaf reads `AT_RISK` (`materialization`, `size`, `checkpoint_distance`), `WATCH` (`base_drift`, 4 behind) and names `evidence`, `interruptions` and `liveness` as `UNOBSERVED`.

## Decomposition gate — small, verifiable, collision-free leaves

DELP keeps progress honest *after* a plan exists. The gate makes the plan itself fit to hand to an agent *before* work starts, with the same discipline: the Coordinator authors the plan, a pure function judges it, the verdict is derived and disposable, and an agent cannot argue with it by publishing a fact (a facts record carrying a `plan` field is rejected: it is not an allowed field). **The gate never moves a percentage**; it only adds a `plan` block, the states `NOT_RELEASEABLE` / `PLAN_GAP` and the admission action `FIX_PLAN`.

### The leaf contract

```yaml
programme:
  total_weight: 10000                 # display scale for "unit points"; never changes a percentage
  decomposition_policy: {mode: ENFORCED}   # OFF (default) | ADVISORY | ENFORCED
nodes:
  - ref: Common#594
    kind: LEAF
    parent: Common#588
    weight: 1
    primary_pr: Common#595
    work_class: PRODUCT               # PRODUCT (default) | MECHANICAL | GATE
    outcome: Replay results are published as TASK_EVIDENCE with durable refs.
    size_budget: {target_loc: 400, hard_loc: 900, target_minutes: 12, hard_minutes: 18}
    write_surface: [src/replay/, docs/replay.md]   # files, or directories ending in '/'; no globs
    depends_on: [Common#592]          # ordering between leaves
    units:
      - {id: V1, weight: 40, verify: the publisher emits CHECKPOINT_FACTS_V1}
      - {id: V2, weight: 30, verify: evidence refs resolve to the replay artefacts}
      - {id: V3, weight: 30, verify: docs/replay.md matches the shipped command}
```

| Rule (defaults) | Finding | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| 3–8 units per `PRODUCT` leaf | `UNITS_BELOW_MIN`, `UNITS_ABOVE_MAX` (the ceiling applies to every class) | blocker |
| no unit above 40% of the leaf (exact integer comparison) | `UNIT_SHARE_OVER` | blocker |
| every unit names how it is verified | `UNIT_VERIFY_MISSING` | blocker |
| the leaf states one observable outcome | `OUTCOME_MISSING` | blocker |
| the leaf declares its write surface | `WRITE_SURFACE_MISSING` | blocker |
| the leaf declares all four `size_budget` keys | `SIZE_BUDGET_MISSING`, `SIZE_BUDGET_INCONSISTENT` (target above hard) | blocker |
| declared hard cap within 1500 LOC / 20 min | `SIZE_OVER_HARD`, with the number of leaves it would take at target size | blocker |
| declared target within 700 LOC / 15 min | `SIZE_OVER_TARGET` | advisory |
| `PRODUCT` leaf target of at least 50 LOC | `LEAF_TOO_SMALL` (an issue and a PR cost more than the work) | advisory |
| overlapping write surfaces are ordered by `depends_on` (transitively) or declared `parallel_ok` | `WRITE_SURFACE_COLLISION` on both leaves | blocker |
| `parallel_ok` carries a `parallel_ok_basis` | `PARALLEL_BASIS_MISSING` | blocker |

`MECHANICAL` and `GATE` leaves (rote batch work, review-only leaves) are exempt from the unit-count floor and the share cap **only**; every other rule still applies, and `decompose-check` prints how many leaves use each class so an over-used exemption is visible in review. Leaves that are `COMPLETE` or `SUPERSEDED` are history and are not judged, and they do not collide with anything (the projection always knows which they are; `decompose-check` knows when given `--facts`). Write surfaces are matched as repo-relative paths: a file equals itself, a directory prefix (trailing `/`) covers everything beneath it, and `src/59/` does not cover `src/592/`.

**Why these defaults.** They follow the written budgets in `PROGRAMME_DECOMPOSITION_PROGRESS.md` (700 target / 1500 hard changed lines, 15 / 20 minutes) and sit near the Young/Daly interval `√(2·δ·M)` for work that is interrupted at random: δ is the cost of a checkpoint and M the mean time between interruptions. Informative, not normative: on the Common executors on 6–7 October 2026 roughly nine interruption episodes (connection loss, stream errors, usage waits) occurred in under seven hours and a checkpoint cost about four minutes, so `√(2·4·45) ≈ 19` minutes. Recompute it with your own rates and override `decomposition_policy.leaf_budget`; `graph-diff` turns any loosening into a recorded Owner decision.

### Modes and what each one changes

| Mode | `decompose-check` | Projection | Admission |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OFF` (default) | informational, exit 0 | no `plan` block, state, title or warning is added; node output is identical to a graph without a policy | unchanged |
| `ADVISORY` | exit 0 | `plan` block and `DECOMPOSITION_BLOCKERS:…` / `DECOMPOSITION_ADVISORIES:…` warnings; no state or title change | `PLAN: WOULD_BLOCK (advisory) — …` line; action unchanged |
| `ENFORCED` | exit 1 on any blocker | a failing leaf becomes `NOT_RELEASEABLE` 🟡 (it replaces `NOT_STARTED` and `ACTIVE` only; every other state is more urgent or already means the leaf is not being worked, and stays); an ancestor shows `PLAN_GAP` only when nothing below it is active and no more urgent state applies | `FIX_PLAN before coding — <code (detail)>… — request a plan update (split or reweight) from the Coordinator; do not start or continue units` |

A leaf that is `NOT_RELEASEABLE` keeps its real `lifecycle` and still counts on the frontier if it is active. Adopt it in three steps: leave it `OFF`; run `decompose-check --mode ADVISORY` to see every finding with no effect; fix the plan; then set `ENFORCED`. `require: {outcome: false, …}` lets a programme enforce only part of the contract while it adopts the rest.

### Re-planning must conserve progress — `graph-diff`

A split, merge, reweight or drop is a plan change and the easiest place to manufacture or lose progress. Every unit and delivery gate has an exact **share of the whole programme**:

```text
share(unit) = Π (sibling weight / (Σ sibling weights + reserve)) down the lineage × leaf coder share × (unit weight / Σ unit weights)
points      = share × programme.total_weight                      (display only)
```

The shares plus every reserve sum to 1, so any change that does not conserve a share moves somebody else's. `graph-diff --old <plan being replaced> --new <proposed plan>` compares them per item (a moved unit is followed through `moved_from: <old leaf>`, same unit id):

| Finding | Meaning | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `POINTS_DRIFT` | a persisting unit or gate changed share and no covering **new** plan update exists | blocker |
| `UNIT_LOST` | a unit or gate disappeared with no covering `UNIT_DROPPED` / `SCOPE_REDUCTION` | blocker |
| `MOVE_ORIGIN_UNKNOWN`, `MOVE_DUPLICATE` | `moved_from` names work the old plan never had, or one old unit is claimed twice | blocker |
| `PLAN_UPDATE_UNAUTHORISED` | a new update lacks `owner_authorized: true` or an `owner_basis` | blocker |
| `PLAN_HISTORY_CHANGED` | an earlier update was edited or removed (`plan_updates` is append-only) | blocker |
| `POLICY_WEAKENED` | mode, limits or `require` loosened without a `POLICY_CHANGE` update | blocker |
| `PLAN_UPDATE_UNUSED` | a new update covers nothing in this change | advisory |

A conserving split needs no update. Worked example (pinned by `PlanConservation`): leaf #592 (weight 3, units U01 20 / U02 30 / U03 25 / U04 25) under #588 beside #594 (weight 1). Move U03 and U04 into a new sibling #620 and rescale the siblings so the parent's denominator is unchanged: #592 keeps weight 3 with U01/U02, #594 becomes weight 2, #620 gets weight 3 with U03/U04 (`moved_from: Common#592`). Every unit keeps its share (U03 stays 9/64 of the programme, 1406.25 points), so the diff reports `CONSERVED` with `moved 2`. Give #620 weight 1 instead and every unit under #588 drifts — U03 falls to 625 points — and the diff names each one. Decomposing `reserve_weight` into new leaves at the same total conserves the existing shares and needs no update; adding scope dilutes everybody and is declared once:

```yaml
plan_updates:                         # append-only
  - id: PU-2026-10-07-01
    kind: SCOPE_EXPANSION             # SCOPE_EXPANSION | SCOPE_REDUCTION | UNIT_REWEIGHT | UNIT_DROPPED | POLICY_CHANGE
    nodes: [Common#588]               # name the node whose denominator changed (and/or units: [Common#592:U04, Common#592:gate:REVIEWER])
    reason: new replay lane added to the phase
    owner_authorized: true
    owner_basis: "Owner instruction in chat, 2026-10-07: …"
```

A `UNIT_DROPPED` update also covers the re-normalisation of the remaining units of the leaf it drops from; a `UNIT_REWEIGHT` or a node-level update covers every unit beneath the node it names. `total_weight` is a display scale: changing it is never drift.

### Where it bites

1. **Plan time (CI).** `decompose-check --graph G` fails the pull request that edits the graph; `graph-diff --old <base version> --new <head version>` fails a re-plan that does not conserve shares:

   ```text
   python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py decompose-check --graph relay/DELP_EXECUTION_GRAPH.yaml
   git show "$BASE_SHA:relay/DELP_EXECUTION_GRAPH.yaml" > /tmp/base-graph.yaml
   python scripts/delp_projection_v35.py graph-diff --old /tmp/base-graph.yaml --new relay/DELP_EXECUTION_GRAPH.yaml
   ```
2. **Task start.** Every `continue`/`proceed` passes `admit`; under `ENFORCED` an unreleasable leaf answers `FIX_PLAN` and an agent has no unit to start.
3. **Title.** `🟡 [#527 › #588 › #594 → PR#595] R:P0/E0 · V1 · NOT_RELEASEABLE` is visible to the Owner without opening anything.
4. **Mid-flight.** An agent that finds its leaf bigger than planned publishes `blocker:` text and stops at an exact frontier; the Coordinator splits the leaf and the `graph-diff` result is the evidence that no progress was created or lost.

## Multi-agent concurrency

Each agent writes facts only to its own leaf. No agent authors parent or programme state; any context may trigger `sync-github`, which reads the graph, the ledger and live PR heads, recomputes leaves first and the programme last, and writes each node with compare-and-swap. Events (`TASK_EVIDENCE` published or recovered, PR created/replaced/merged, candidate moved, unit completed, responsibility materialised/complete/superseded, dependency or denominator change, owner command admission) trigger *reprojection*, which is not the same as *progress*: a PR opening changes a title and not `P/E`; a commit can lower `E`; a rerun changes nothing.

## Operating it

```text
validate-graph --graph G                         plan is structurally valid
validate-facts F...                              reject agent-authored projections (exit 1)
project --graph G --facts F... --observations O  deterministic projection JSON (+ expected titles)
admit --graph G --facts F --observations O --leaf L --command continue
health --graph G --facts F --observations O [--leaf L] [--mode M] [--json]   advisory delivery-continuity health of started leaves (always exits 0)
frontier --graph G (--facts F --observations O | --repository R) --leaf L   the derived frontier a handover may carry (observed + derived, digest-bound)
frontier-verify --snapshot S --graph G (…) --leaf L   is a handed-over frontier still true? (exit 2 when any input moved)
decompose-check --graph G [--mode M] [--facts F --observations O]   judge the plan against the decomposition policy (exit 1 on blockers when ENFORCED)
graph-diff --old G0 --new G1                     a re-plan must conserve every unit's share and record its scope changes (exit 1 otherwise)
verify-titles --graph G --facts F --observations O --actual-titles T     (exit 2 on drift)
sync-github --graph G --repository owner/repo    observe PR heads + CHECKPOINT_FACTS_V1 comments, write titles + LIVE_STATUS with compare-and-swap
sync-github ... --dry-run                        read-only first run: drift, rejected facts and the exact titles it would write
```

The runner (Coordinator tick or a scoped workflow) is the **only** writer of generated titles. Agents without script access are unaffected: they publish the facts block and keep working. `templates/delp-cron-workflow-v35.yml` is an inert example of a scheduled runner; it is not an active workflow.

## Legacy and compatibility

- `scripts/continuity_projection.py` snapshots now carry `projection_mode`. `init` defaults to `DERIVED_FROM_FACTS`: `unit-update --evidenced` is rejected, `E` is computed from `evidence_refs` plus an `evidence_candidate` equal to the observed head, and `sync-github` never patches the title (one title writer). `LEGACY_AGENT_ASSERTED` remains readable and behaves exactly as before, rendered with an explicit historical-warning line; a missing value is read as legacy. Nothing historical is rewritten.
- The earlier candidate title forms in `OWNER_CHECKPOINT_PROJECTION.md`, `PROGRAMME_DECOMPOSITION_PROGRESS.md` and `CHECKPOINT_AND_LIVENESS_CONTRACT.md` are superseded by this grammar; their other content (three-view architecture, information budget, checkpoint thresholds, liveness model) is unchanged.
- The compact Owner chat checkpoint (`TASK_EVIDENCE — CHECKPOINT … UNIT / DELTA / BLOCKER / OWNER_ACTION / NEXT / EVIDENCE`) is unchanged and is rendered from the same projection; the `CONTINUE CHECKPOINT` above is the admission-time form.

## Amendment of V3.2

`skills/engineering-pr-delivery-v3.2/**` was frozen by #492/#494 and is guarded in CI. The Owner explicitly instructed that this fix land in both V3.2 and V3.5. The V3.2 changes are therefore an **additive amendment**: new `delp_projection_v32.py`, its schemas and tests, the DERIVED mode of `continuity_projection.py`, the `CONTINUE_RECONCILE` intent, and the documentation updates. The freeze guard permits exactly the paths listed in `skills/Local_PR_Deliverty_v1.1/integration/frozen-v32-amendments.yaml` and fails on any other change. Governance-critical: merge remains Owner-controlled.

## Invariants (each is pinned by a test)

1. Every artifact resolves to exactly one owning leaf; every leaf resolves to exactly one programme lineage.
2. Every percentage carries its scope; a bare percentage is invalid.
3. Leaf `P/E` come from declared weighted units; `E <= P`; evidence progress never exceeds semantic progress.
4. Parent/programme `D/E` are recomputed from children, never incremented, never authored.
5. Candidate movement cannot silently preserve stale evidence qualification.
6. Missing evidence stays visible (`EVIDENCE_GAP`) until recovered; material work after a gap starts with recovery.
7. Agents publish facts on their own leaf only; agent-authored projections are rejected and inert.
8. Same inputs ⇒ same projection and same titles; concurrent writers cannot use last-writer-wins.
9. Continuation commands reconstruct before executing and never change programme semantics.
10. Parent issues with material work materialise explicit child leaves.
11. Titles and `LIVE_STATUS_V1` are disposable projections, never authority; if every title and status disappeared they would be rebuilt from durable sources.
12. The decomposition gate judges the plan only: it never reads facts, never moves a percentage, and with the mode `OFF` adds nothing to any node or admission output.
13. Under `ENFORCED`, a leaf whose plan fails the gate is never admitted to new work (`FIX_PLAN`), and a re-plan that moves any unit's programme share without a covering, authorised, append-only plan update is rejected by `graph-diff`.
14. Unknown is never published as zero: a leaf the provider shows work for but whose ledger has no accepted facts is `UNMATERIALIZED`, its ancestors say their numbers are a lower bound, and its admission answer is `MATERIALIZE_FACTS`.
15. A plan is only ever applied to the repository it declares.
16. A handover carries only observed and derived values, bound by a digest; a successor verifies it against live truth, and any moved input means recompute, never trust.
17. Health is observed or derived, never declared. `UNOBSERVED` is never healthy, the verdict is the worst component rather than an average, and the block is advisory: it never moves a number, a state, a title or an admission answer.

## Not claimed

DELP cannot technically prevent a human or agent from hand-editing a GitHub title or comment; it makes that edit non-authoritative, detectable and self-correcting. It does not verify that an agent's evidence ref is truthful (that remains review, `NOT_RUN` integrity and the evidence gate); it verifies that evidence exists, is typed, and is bound to the current candidate. It does not grant or infer merge, acceptance or programme authority.

Health reads provider and ledger telemetry and operator observations; it says nothing about the quality or value of the work, and a green verdict is evidence only that nothing observed is wrong. Until an observer produces the diff-size, liveness and interruption inputs, those components are `UNOBSERVED`. The operator's `AGENT_OBSERVATION_V1` has no identity separation from an agent's facts on a single GitHub account, so it is advisory by construction.

`UNMATERIALIZED` fires only on what the provider shows: a leaf with no pull request and no branch commits, or a run with no observations at all, reads `NOT_STARTED` because nothing shows otherwise. It marks the roll-up as a lower bound; it does not estimate the missing work, and work outside the graph (the reserve) stays unknown until it is decomposed. Merge state never completes a leaf, and DELP does not backfill facts on anyone's behalf: publishing them remains the agent's or the Coordinator's act.

The decomposition gate checks that a plan is self-consistent, sized within policy and collision-free *as declared*; it cannot know whether a size estimate is honest or whether a declared `write_surface` matches the diff that is eventually pushed (comparing the two is a separate, runtime check). It checks that a `verify` step is present, not that it is a good one. A `MECHANICAL` or `GATE` classification is a Coordinator declaration, made visible by the class counts but not independently verified. `owner_authorized` and `owner_basis` in a plan update are a durable, reviewable record, not proof of who wrote them: the Owner's review of the pull request that edits the graph remains the control, and verifying the cited basis against the repository's own comments is future work.
