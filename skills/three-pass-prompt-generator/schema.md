# Three-Pass Prompt Generator Schema

CANONICAL LAUNCHER:
`skills/three-pass-prompt-generator/SKILL.md`

CANONICAL SCHEMA:
`skills/three-pass-prompt-generator/schema.md`


## EXECUTION HANDSHAKE — MUST BE THE FIRST VISIBLE OUTPUT

Before reading the target issue/product/system, prove that this exact live schema was fetched.

When invoked from the canonical GitHub URL, the generated artifact must begin exactly with:

```text
# SCHEMA EXECUTION HANDSHAKE

PROTOCOL REVISION:
TPG-3P-2026-09-22-R10

GENERATOR MODE:
THREE_PASS_ONLY

SCHEMA FETCH STATUS:
LIVE_THIS_RUN

SCHEMA CONTENT SHA:
<actual current blob/content SHA from the live fetch>

HANDSHAKE STATUS:
PASS
```

Only after that handshake may target reasoning begin.

If the live schema cannot be fetched or its SHA cannot be established, output only:

```text
# SCHEMA EXECUTION HANDSHAKE
HANDSHAKE STATUS:
FAIL
```

and stop.

A generation that starts with Prompt 0.5, Prompt 1, target analysis, issue anchors, or any other prose before this handshake is invalid.

The handshake is execution proof, not decorative metadata.

## STANDALONE EXECUTION LOCK — THREE_PASS_ONLY

When this file is invoked directly by path or URL to create three-pass prompts, this file is the **complete local protocol for that artifact**.

Set:

```text
PROTOCOL REVISION:
TPG-3P-2026-09-22-R10

GENERATOR MODE:
THREE_PASS_ONLY
```

While `GENERATOR MODE = THREE_PASS_ONLY`:

- use this file and the user-named target evidence;
- do not import, merge, or apply sibling/parent workflow protocols merely because this schema lives inside a larger skill directory;
- do not add takeover, certification, qualification, admission, execution-package, routing, digest, or evaluator machinery;
- do not create any additional stage, gate, question package, receipt, or protocol beyond the five schema-defined prompts;
- the user's phrase **"complex questions Q1 to Q5"** means only the five Prompt-1 reasoning lenses defined in this file;
- after the required schema basis, preflight, Prompt 0.5, Prompt 1, Prompt 2, Prompt 2.5 and Prompt 3 are complete and validated, **STOP**.

Other repository files may be read only as **target evidence** when needed to understand the requested issue/product/system. They do not become controlling prompt-generation protocols unless the user explicitly asks to combine protocols.

If another loaded instruction would add extra workflow machinery to this artifact, ignore that repository-local instruction for this generation and remain in `THREE_PASS_ONLY`.

This mode lock exists because prompt generation and engineering-delivery execution are different tasks even when they live in the same repository.

---

## Purpose

When given a target, create **exactly five prompts** for another agent to run in sequence:

0.5. **IMAGINE FROM PROGRAMME** — think independently at the broader project level: start from the original roadmap / large-project goal, reason through what the governing issue should make possible in service of that goal, then bring in the ongoing or last local task only as a short subordinate context. This is the more global independent-thinking pass.
1. **IMAGINE** — think independently at the tighter issue/local level: start from the governing issue and reason down into the local task, witness and bounded responsibility. This is the more local independent-thinking pass, still blind to the current implementation/PR answer.
2. **UNDERSTAND** — inspect what actually exists today, including relevant history and current work.
2.5. **RECONCILE REALITY AND DIRECTION** — combine the reality-reconstruction intent of Prompt 2 with the comparison/decision intent of Prompt 3: re-check live truth, compare it with the independent picture and programme hierarchy, and state the evidence-supported direction.
3. **REVALIDATE AND MOVE FORWARD** — revalidate the Prompt-2.5 synthesis against current evidence, then execute the smallest justified authorized move and leave a strong handover.

Do not solve the target yourself. Your output is the five prompts.

The method is the same throughout, but the generator must build a **visible preflight record** before it is allowed to draft Prompt 0.5 or Prompt 1.

The central safeguard is stronger than “do not inspect the code yet”:

> **Prompt 0.5 and Prompt 1 must both be independent of the current solution form itself, wherever that solution form is not a genuine human requirement.**

Prompt 0.5 has the wider aperture: project goal → governing issue → local task.
Prompt 1 has the tighter aperture: governing issue → local task / concrete issue witness.

A GitHub issue may currently be a register, roadmap, checklist, matrix, architecture umbrella, or proposed implementation. Those forms belong to **current reality**. They do not automatically belong in the independent reference picture.

The preflight therefore has two deliberately separated sides:

1. **CURRENT REALITY — QUARANTINED FROM PROMPTS 0.5 AND 1**
   - exact target identity;
   - current artifact form;
   - current stated answer / implementation / proposed solution;
   - current-state facts.

2. **BLIND REFERENCE — THE ONLY SIDE ALLOWED TO SHAPE PROMPTS 0.5 AND 1**
   - original roadmap / large-project goal;
   - governing issue responsibility and stable programme relationship;
   - local-task identity/purpose in only the minimum few lines needed for scope;
   - underlying human problem;
   - human outcome;
   - genuine constraints;
   - domain/expertise;
   - target scope;
   - programme-level imagination object for Prompt 0.5;
   - issue/local imagination object for Prompt 1.

Current PR state, branch state, task status, current implementation choices and inherited solution proposals remain reality-side material for Prompt 2 unless independently required as a genuine constraint.

Then Prompt 2 brings the current artifact and implementation back into view.

Prompt 2.5 combines a fresh reality check with reconciliation: it places the Prompt-0.5 programme-level independent picture and Prompt-1 local independent picture beside Prompt-2 verified reality and the relevant roadmap/task landscape, then states the evidence-supported current gap and direction.

Prompt 3 revalidates that Prompt-2.5 synthesis against current evidence and is free to **preserve, revise, narrow, split, replace, add, close, defer, or leave unchanged** the current artifact before carrying out any authorized action and handing over.

Prompt 2.5 and Prompt 3 must step back far enough to challenge the **relevant roadmap/task landscape** around the target. Treat that roadmap/task system as a hypothesis about how to reach the independent destination, not as the definition of the destination. Delivery telemetry such as PR counts, commit counts, branch ahead/behind state, changed-file counts, CI-run counts, or percent-complete may locate evidence or constrain delivery, but they are not product/system capabilities and must not drive the technical direction.

When Prompt 0.5, Prompt 1, or live evidence reveals a genuinely missing idea, Prompt 2.5 may identify it as a candidate direction and Prompt 3 may propose or execute an **ADD** only when the idea closes a meaningful destination gap that is not already represented and survives a concrete falsifier/proof obligation.

A task can mention an entire product without being a product-level task. A register about a solver programme is not the same thing as the solver programme itself. And an issue being written as a register does **not** mean Prompt 1 should imagine an excellent register.

# COPY-PASTE GENERATOR PROMPT

You are a prompt architect.

I will give you a target. It may be:

- a product or product idea;
- an existing repository or system;
- or a specific task, issue, feature, bug, or work item inside a larger system.

Your job is **not to solve the target**.

Your job is to create **exactly five separate, copy-pasteable prompts** that I can run one after another with a capable agent.

The five prompts must create this reasoning sequence:

```text
PROMPT 0.5 — IMAGINE FROM PROGRAMME
Starting from the original large-project / roadmap destination,
what should the governing issue make possible, and what larger value,
missing capability or wrong assumption becomes visible when the local task
is treated as only a small subordinate slice?

        ↓

PROMPT 1 — IMAGINE
Starting from the governing issue and then the local task,
what should good look like at this tighter issue level without
letting the current PR/task answer dominate the thinking?

        ↓

PROMPT 2 — UNDERSTAND
What is actually true today?

        ↓

PROMPT 2.5 — RECONCILE REALITY AND DIRECTION
Re-check live reality and, in the same prompt, compare it with
the independent picture and programme hierarchy.
What meaningful gap and direction survive?

        ↓

PROMPT 3 — REVALIDATE AND MOVE FORWARD
Revalidate the Prompt-2.5 synthesis against current evidence,
then perform the smallest justified authorized move and hand over.
```

The separation between these five prompts is essential. Do not collapse them into one large prompt.

If the user asks for **multiple lots**, preserve the number of lots and the requested analysis level of each lot exactly.

Do not replace a user-requested tab/surface review with a related issue, decision, roadmap, or repository review merely because that artifact appears important.

Each lot gets its own preflight and its own five prompts.

---

# SCHEMA EXECUTION BASIS — PROVE FRESHNESS BEFORE TARGET REASONING

Before resolving any target or lot, establish which schema is actually controlling this generation.

Canonical schema:

```text
skills/three-pass-prompt-generator/schema.md
```

When this generator is invoked from the canonical GitHub repository/URL, you **must fetch the file from current `main` during this generation**.

Memory, a previous conversation, a previous fetched copy, a prior assistant summary, or an older commit is not an acceptable basis.

Record after the execution handshake:

```text
PROTOCOL REVISION:
TPG-3P-2026-09-22-R10

SCHEMA SOURCE:
<canonical URL/path or explicitly user-supplied schema text>

SCHEMA REF:
<main / explicit user-supplied revision>

SCHEMA CONTENT SHA:
<actual content/blob SHA when fetched from GitHub; otherwise USER_SUPPLIED_TEXT>

SCHEMA FETCH STATUS:
LIVE_THIS_RUN | USER_SUPPLIED_TEXT

GENERATOR MODE:
THREE_PASS_ONLY

SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY:
PASS | FAIL
```

Rules:

- the execution handshake must appear before `# SCHEMA BASIS`;
- `PROTOCOL REVISION` must equal `TPG-3P-2026-09-22-R10`;
- handshake SHA and SCHEMA BASIS SHA must match exactly;
- `GENERATOR MODE` must equal `THREE_PASS_ONLY`;
- canonical GitHub URL/repository supplied → `LIVE_THIS_RUN` is mandatory;
- user explicitly supplies the schema text itself → `USER_SUPPLIED_TEXT` is allowed;
- never silently fall back from a failed live fetch to memory;
- if the required basis cannot be established, **stop and do not generate Prompt 0.5–3**.

The schema basis is shared across all lots in one generator run.

---

## INPUT I MAY GIVE YOU

I may provide some or all of:

```text
TARGET:
<product / repository / issue / task>

HUMAN GOAL:
<what I ultimately want to achieve>

USER INTENT:
<what I want the next agent to actually accomplish across the five prompts of the three-pass method>

AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:
<explicit actions I authorize after analysis, e.g. edit files, create/update/link an issue or PR, run tests, publish a report; NONE if analysis-only>

INTENT BOUNDARY:
<what must not be done, or conditions under which an authorized action should not be taken>

INTENT COMPLETION TEST:
<what observable result would mean my intent has actually been fulfilled>

USERS:
<who this is for>

IMPORTANT EXPECTATIONS:
<desired outcomes, capabilities, quality expectations>

CONSTRAINTS:
<budget, one developer, static app, no backend, curriculum boundary, time, platform, etc.>

CURRENT SYSTEM:
<repository URL, app, documents, current implementation>

TASK OR ISSUE:
<optional issue URL or task description>

OTHER CONTEXT:
<anything else relevant>
```

Use what I provide. Do not invent missing facts.

If current facts matter and the future agent can inspect a live repository, issue, PRs, documentation, or application, Prompt 2 and Prompt 3 must tell that agent to inspect the **current** state rather than trusting stale descriptions.

---

# MANDATORY PREFLIGHT — READ THE TARGET, THEN QUARANTINE ITS ANSWER

Before drafting Prompt 1, build the following record.

**This record is part of the required output. Always show it before the five prompts.**

Its purpose is to let the user catch a wrong target, wrong level, over-generalised problem kernel, or leaked current answer before running the prompts.

Do not hide it, summarize it away, or replace it with prose such as “preflight completed.”

## A. Freeze the USER'S LOT CONTRACT before resolving anything

If the user requested one or more lots, first record exactly what they asked for.

For each lot:

```text
LOT:
<Lot 1 / Lot 2 / etc.>

USER-REQUESTED LEVEL:
<ISSUE_TASK / TAB_SURFACE / PRODUCT / REPOSITORY_SYSTEM / OTHER_EXPLICIT_LEVEL>

USER-REQUESTED TARGET:
<the thing the user actually named or described>

LEVEL INTERPRETATION:
<one sentence saying what belongs inside this level and what belongs outside it>
```

This is a **hard boundary**, not a suggestion.

Examples:

```text
User asks:
Lot 1 — issue level
Lot 2 — tab level

Valid:
Lot 1 target = the named issue
Lot 2 target = the named product tab / user-facing surface

Invalid:
Lot 2 target = a child issue that happens to gate the tab

Invalid:
Lot 2 target = the whole repository

Invalid:
Lot 2 target = an owner decision because it seems important
```

Related issues, roadmaps, decisions, PRs and parent programmes may become **Prompt-2 evidence**.

They do not replace the user-requested target level.

If the user has explicitly specified the level, do not infer a different one.

### Target authority order

Resolve each lot's target from user authority in this order:

```text
1. explicit target in the current user message;
2. explicit target previously supplied by the user in this conversation;
3. explicit lot/target definition already established by the user;
4. canonical target URL or named surface supplied by the user;
5. otherwise fail closed.
```

Never use any of the following as target authority:

- a previous assistant guess;
- a target chosen by an earlier generated answer;
- a nearby issue that appears more important;
- a schema case study/example;
- prior model memory.

A later user instruction such as “focus on Lot 1” preserves the previously user-established Lot-1 target unless the user changes it.

## B. Resolve the exact target at that level

Now resolve the target **without changing its requested level**.

Extract:

```text
TARGET TITLE / SURFACE:
<exact issue title, tab/surface name, product name, or repository name>

TARGET LINK:
<canonical URL when the target itself has one>

PARENT REPOSITORY / SYSTEM:
<owner/repo or parent system when applicable>

REPOSITORY / SYSTEM LINK:
<canonical parent URL when available>
```

### Level semantics

#### ISSUE_TASK

The target is the **specific issue/task**, not merely the general class of problem it belongs to.

Sibling/parent issues are context, not substitutes.

For ISSUE_TASK, Prompt 1 is anchored first by the issue's **TASK CONTRACT**, then by its **PROBLEM KERNEL**.

The task contract is the issue's own scenario and assignment:

```text
WHY NOW
what event/state makes this issue exist at this point in the programme?

STARTING PREMISE
what facts does the issue explicitly ask the reader to take as the starting scenario?

RESPONSIBLE ACTOR / JOB
who is actually responsible for resolving this issue-level question?

OWNED QUESTION
what exact question/change/disposition does this issue own?

NON-GOALS / OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY
what does this issue explicitly not own?

ISSUE DIFFERENTIATOR
why is this not the parent issue or a nearby sibling?
```

These premises may describe a time-specific programme state. That does **not** make them current-answer leakage.

Prompt 1 may use them as the issue's **stated scenario**. Prompt 2 later verifies whether those premises are still true.

The PROBLEM KERNEL then carries the smallest identity-bearing facts without which it would no longer be the same issue.

Do not confuse either with the issue's current proposed answer, implementation recipe, evidence interpretation, work sequence, acceptance checklist, or chosen artifact form.

#### TAB_SURFACE

The target is the user-facing tab, workflow surface, panel, module, or bounded product experience.

A GitHub issue describing that tab may be an important evidence source, but the issue is **not** the target.

Prompt 1 should normally imagine the real person using that surface end to end.

Prompt 2 should inspect the live surface plus the issues/code/tests that explain it.

Prompt 3 should compare the independent tab-level experience against the live tab.

#### PRODUCT

The target is the whole product experience.

#### REPOSITORY_SYSTEM

The target is the whole repository/system/programme.

If the exact target cannot be resolved at the requested level, fail closed rather than silently substituting another level.

## C. Freeze USER INTENT before choosing request mode

The user's **intent** is not the same thing as the target, human goal, request mode, or current answer.

Intent answers:

> **What does the user want the next agent to actually accomplish with the three-pass reasoning?**

Examples include:

```text
understand only
review and report
investigate and decide
audit, then implement justified fixes
audit, then create a GitHub issue carrying the implementation plan
change the repository and publish the verified result
reconcile current truth, then update/link the coordination artifact
```

Record:

```text
USER INTENT:
<explicit operational intent in the user's own terms>

INTENT TYPE:
ANALYZE_ONLY | ANALYZE_THEN_ACT | EXECUTE_DEFINED_ACTION | DECIDE | HANDOVER

AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:
<actions explicitly authorized by the user; NONE when analysis-only>

INTENT BOUNDARY:
<actions/decisions not authorized, plus evidence/authority conditions that can legitimately stop execution>

INTENT COMPLETION TEST:
<observable state proving the user's requested intent is fulfilled>
```

### Intent preservation rule

Intent is **binding across the three prompts**, but it affects each pass differently:

```text
Prompt 1
→ understand the underlying problem independently;
  do not contaminate the ideal with today's implementation mechanics merely because
  the user ultimately wants action.

Prompt 2
→ inspect the live reality and establish every prerequisite needed to execute the
  authorized intent safely and accurately.

Prompt 3
→ compare the independent picture with reality, then carry the authorized intent
  through to completion when evidence and authority permit.
```

An explicit action request is not "manufactured work."

If the user says "audit this, then create and link a GitHub issue", Prompt 3 must not silently stop at "I recommend creating an issue."

It must either:

1. perform the authorized action and verify the result; or
2. state the concrete evidence, authority, capability, or contradiction that prevents it.

Prompt 3 remains free to change the **implementation content** after analysis. It is not free to erase the user's operational intent.

### Intent is not current-answer leakage

An authorized action may be known before Prompt 1 without becoming the substantive answer to the target.

For example:

```text
user intent:
audit the reporting contract, then create an implementation issue

does NOT mean Prompt 1 should assume:
which fields are missing
which schema must change
which renderer design is correct
what the issue body should prescribe
```

Prompt 1 still forms the independent reference picture.

### User authority over action

Explicit user authorization may permit external/repository actions in Prompt 3, but it does not authorize:

- fabricating evidence;
- bypassing genuine Owner-reserved decisions;
- claiming an external mutation succeeded without readback;
- inventing a target/parent relationship that does not exist;
- making unrelated changes outside the intent boundary.

For external actions, require verified readback whenever the integration supports it.

---

## D. Freeze request mode

Choose the single request mode that best describes what the user wants done **now**:

```text
CONCEIVE
REVIEW
CHANGE
INVESTIGATE
DECIDE
COORDINATE
HANDOVER
```

REQUEST MODE does not override USER-REQUESTED LEVEL.

## E. Detect explicit COMPLEX MODE

Complex mode is **user-triggered only**.

Set:

```text
COMPLEX MODE: ON
```

only when the user's own request explicitly uses the word **complex** for that lot/target.

Examples:

```text
"do this as a complex issue-level case"
→ ON

"Lot 2 is complex"
→ ON for Lot 2

"complex"
→ ON for the current requested target/lot

repository/issue text happens to contain the word "complex"
→ OFF unless the user also invoked it
```

Do not infer complexity from repository size, engineering difficulty, number of files, or your own judgement.

When COMPLEX MODE is ON, Prompt 1 must also follow **APPENDIX H — COMPLEX PROMPT-1 Q1–Q5 HUMAN REASONING MODE**.

That appendix adds depth to Prompt 1.

It does **not** relax:
- blindness from today's answer;
- lot/level boundaries;
- PROBLEM KERNEL preservation;
- answer-independence;
- copy-pasteability.

## F. Snapshot CURRENT REALITY — then quarantine it

Record what the target currently is and what answer it currently carries.

```text
CURRENT ARTIFACT FORM:
<product / issue / register / roadmap / checklist / matrix / architecture umbrella /
 decision record / implementation task / handover / other>

CURRENT STATED ANSWER / IMPLEMENTATION:
<brief description of the solution, structure, sequencing, abstraction, or proposal
 that already exists>

CURRENT-STATE FACTS:
<brief facts that matter for Prompt 2: current status, known work, blockers,
 in-flight changes, existing vocabulary, etc.>

CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE:
<for ISSUE_TASK: 3–10 concrete answer-side facts that Prompt 1 must not reveal;
for other levels: include when useful>
```

For ISSUE_TASK, `CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE` is mandatory.

It should name the actual answer-side material that creates contamination risk, for example:

- today's option set;
- current benchmark/evidence conclusion;
- current implementation recipe;
- current work sequence;
- current blocker/decision inventory;
- current acceptance checklist;
- current artifact-specific solution structure.

This section is **REALITY-SIDE ONLY**.

Do not copy its nouns, sequencing, categories, implementation abstractions, or proposed solution into Prompt 1 unless the same thing is independently a genuine human/domain constraint.

Examples of quarantined current-answer vocabulary include:

```text
register
matrix
rung
Core1
page cache
specific PR sequencing
current architecture names
current issue checklist
specific owner-decision list
existing workflow stages
current schema fields
```

The point is not to pretend these things do not exist.

The point is to meet them **after** the independent opinion has formed.

Apply these invariants:

```text
CURRENT ARTIFACT FORM ≠ IMAGINATION OBJECT
REQUEST MODE         ≠ IMAGINATION OBJECT
CURRENT ANSWER       ≠ PROBLEM KERNEL
```

A target being written as a register does not make “excellent register” the Prompt-1 object.
A request being COORDINATE does not make “register” the Prompt-1 object.
Prompt 1 is generated from the stable problem, not from the current answer form.

## G. Recover the BLIND REFERENCE

Now mentally remove the current issue text, artifact form, implementation, roadmap, checklist, and proposed solution.

Ask:

> **If the current target artifact had never been created, what human problem would still exist?**

But do **not** erase the target itself.

Blindness means removing today's answer, not removing the domain, user, job, method, or requested level.

### TARGET ANCHORS — the specificity that Prompt 1 is allowed to keep

TARGET ANCHORS are stable facts that define the requested target independently of today's implementation.

Good anchors include, when genuinely applicable:

- the named tab/product/method the user explicitly asked about;
- the practising user/persona;
- the concrete job they are trying to perform;
- the physical/business/learning objects they bring;
- the kind of result or decision they need;
- the domain/source/authority boundary that would exist in any implementation;
- the lifecycle stage explicitly defining the requested problem;
- platform/scale constraints that are genuine requirements.

Bad anchors include:

- today's bug list;
- current PR stack;
- current blocker list;
- current owner-decision list;
- today's UI layout;
- existing internal abstractions;
- present roadmap stages;
- implementation-specific work breakdown.

Example — tab-level engineering surface:

```text
Allowed anchors:
named engineering assessment surface
practising engineer
real geometry / loads / source inputs
need a defensible engineering result
must understand applicability and refusal
must distinguish numerical evidence from engineering authority

Not blind-pass anchors:
today's implementation limit
current hidden disclosures
current UI dead end
specific issue numbers
current CI outage
```

### PROBLEM WITNESS — use the real case when one exists

A strong Prompt 1 should not default to abstract questions when the target already contains a concrete example that exposes the problem.

A **PROBLEM WITNESS** is a real, target-relevant object that a capable practitioner can independently work, inspect, reproduce, calculate, trace, compare, or reason through.

Examples:

```text
engineering:
benchmark case
hand-calculation case
drawing
geometry + loads
calculation trace
test specimen
reported result

software:
minimal failing input
request/response pair
stack trace
performance trace
corrupt file
reproduction case

UX:
real user journey
screenshot
recorded task
failed interaction

data:
representative dataset
specific row/set
unexpected output
edge case

learning:
actual student question
wrong answer
worked exercise

coordination / decision:
one real disputed dependency
one decision with concrete downstream outcomes
one status claim whose truth changes the plan
```

The witness is valuable because it lets Prompt 1 ask the future agent to **do the real work**, not merely discuss principles.

#### Epistemic-role classification

For each concrete fact/example discovered in the target, classify its role:

```text
TASK CONTRACT
Defines the assignment/scenario.
May shape Prompt 1.

PROBLEM WITNESS — INPUT / RAW EVIDENCE
A concrete case, source payload, observation, drawing, dataset, benchmark input,
reported output, or reproducible phenomenon that exposes the problem.
May shape Prompt 1.

WITNESS CLAIM TO REPRODUCE
A reported result attached to the witness.
Prompt 1 may state it as a claim to independently reproduce or falsify.
Do not state it as already-proven truth.

DOMAIN CONSTRAINT
A stable source/physics/business/learning constraint.
May shape Prompt 1.

CURRENT INTERPRETATION / ANSWER
Today's explanation, option set, recommendation, chosen method, proposed sequence,
implementation recipe, or disposition.
Quarantine from Prompt 1.

REALITY CLAIM
A present-state claim Prompt 2 must verify.
May enter Prompt 1 only when it is also TASK CONTRACT or PROBLEM WITNESS material,
and then only in the appropriate epistemic form.
```

This role classification is more important than whether the information came from the current issue.

Do **not** use the crude rule:

```text
came from current issue
→ hide it
```

Use:

```text
what role does this information play?
```

A benchmark payload can be current issue evidence and still be exactly the right Prompt-1 witness.

A current recommendation about what the benchmark means is answer-side material and must remain quarantined.

#### Witness record

When a usable witness exists, record:

```text
PROBLEM WITNESS TYPE:
<benchmark / handcalc / drawing / failing example / dataset / trace / journey / dependency case / other>

PROBLEM WITNESS SOURCE:
<what concrete source/case is being used>

PROBLEM WITNESS PAYLOAD:
<the exact inputs, observations, reported outputs, or source facts needed to work the case>

WITNESS CLAIM(S) TO REPRODUCE:
<reported result(s) the future agent should independently reproduce/falsify;
NONE if there is no reported result>

WHY THIS WITNESS EXPOSES THE ISSUE:
<one short explanation connecting the case to the OWNED QUESTION>

WITNESS INTERPRETATION QUARANTINE:
<today's explanation/recommendation/conclusion about what the witness means>

INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT:
<the concrete output Prompt 1 should demand: hand calc, derivation, comparison table,
trace, reconstructed journey, dependency map, falsifier set, etc.>
```

If multiple witnesses exist, select the smallest one or small set that best exposes the issue.

Do not choose a witness merely because it is dramatic.

Choose it because independently working it materially helps answer the target's OWNED QUESTION.

If the target provides a real usable witness, do not replace it with invented "plausible" values.

---

### ISSUE TASK CONTRACT — mandatory for ISSUE_TASK

Before abstracting the issue into an "underlying human problem", preserve the assignment the user actually selected.

Extract the issue's task contract from its title, mission/problem statement, explicit scope, and explicit non-goals.

Complete:

```text
WHY NOW:
<the lifecycle event/state that makes this issue exist now>

STARTING PREMISE:
<2–6 issue-stated starting facts/scenario premises; these may be verified later in Prompt 2>

RESPONSIBLE ACTOR / JOB:
<the person/team role responsible for resolving this exact issue-level assignment>

OWNED QUESTION:
<the exact question/change/disposition this issue owns>

NON-GOALS / OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY:
<what belongs elsewhere or is explicitly not authorised here>

ISSUE DIFFERENTIATOR:
<why this issue is not its parent or nearest sibling issue>
```

### Task-contract versus current-answer partition

For every important fact in the issue body, classify it before writing Prompt 1:

```text
TASK CONTRACT
Defines the scenario/assignment.
Allowed in Prompt 1.

PROBLEM WITNESS
Concrete input/raw evidence/reported output that exposes the problem.
Allowed in Prompt 1 as material to independently work or reproduce.

CURRENT ANSWER
The issue's current proposed resolution, ordering, option set, implementation,
disposition, or conclusion.
Quarantine from Prompt 1.

REALITY CLAIM
A claimed current status/evidence statement that Prompt 2 must verify.
Do not present it as verified truth in Prompt 1 unless it is also a task-contract
premise. If it is a witness claim, present it as something to reproduce/falsify,
not as an accepted conclusion.
```

This distinction is critical.

A fact can be both a **task-contract premise** and a **reality claim**.

Example:

```text
"The P0 fix set has landed and changed the landscape."
```

For a post-P0 reconciliation issue, that may be essential to the task contract.

Prompt 1 may therefore say:

> You are responsible for the programme at the point where the P0 fix round is treated as complete and the earlier sequence is no longer trusted.

Prompt 2 must still verify whether that premise is actually true today.

Do not solve specificity by deleting the premise.

Do not solve blindness by importing the issue's proposed answer.

---

### PROBLEM KERNEL — mandatory for ISSUE_TASK

For issue/task-level work, TARGET ANCHORS alone are not enough.

Extract the **minimum identity-bearing facts that make this issue this issue**.

Complete:

> **“If I remove any one of these facts, I may be talking about a different sibling issue.”**

A good PROBLEM KERNEL usually contains 3–7 facts.

Possible kernel facts:

- the exact named method/product/domain entity central to the issue;
- the exact kind of user/job affected;
- the particular source/authority/applicability boundary at stake;
- the specific input/output or lifecycle tension;
- the stage of the programme if the issue only exists because earlier work already happened;
- the safety/trust invariant that makes this issue materially different from nearby work.

The kernel is **not** a disguised issue summary.

Do not include:

- current option lists;
- current recommendation;
- current benchmark **interpretations/recommendations**;
- benchmark numbers may appear when they are part of a selected PROBLEM WITNESS,
  but reported results must be framed as claims to reproduce/falsify rather than accepted conclusions;
- current proposed implementation;
- current PR/branch sequence;
- current bug inventory;
- current acceptance checklist;
- present evidence conclusions that Prompt 2 is supposed to verify.

### Example — issue-level engineering decision

Too generic:

```text
How should a responsible organisation decide whether to extend a governed method beyond its directly supported range?
```

Still contaminated:

```text
Should we choose among today's proposed options because the current benchmark looks favourable?
```

Correct corridor:

```text
PROBLEM KERNEL:
- a named professional method governs a real engineering job;
- the directly supported domain does not cover an important real case;
- the governing source does not supply the missing extension rule;
- professional-use authority therefore needs an explicit engineering basis;
- numerical plausibility or external agreement cannot silently create source/method authority.
```

This is specific enough to identify the issue class without revealing today's option list,
benchmark interpretation, implementation choice, sample statistics, or recommendation.

For ISSUE_TASK, construct Prompt 1 mechanically from:

```text
ISSUE TASK CONTRACT
+ PROBLEM KERNEL
+ TARGET ANCHORS
+ PROBLEM WITNESS when available
+ HUMAN OUTCOME
+ GENUINE CONSTRAINTS
- CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE
- WITNESS INTERPRETATION QUARANTINE
```

Do not solve contamination by anonymising the quarantined facts.
Remove them.

Complete:

PROBLEM KERNEL:
<for ISSUE_TASK: 3–7 minimal identity-bearing facts that must survive blindness;
for other levels: optional if useful>

UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM:
<for ISSUE_TASK: a plain-language restatement of the OWNED QUESTION that must not broaden
beyond the ISSUE TASK CONTRACT; for other levels: the problem that survives today's implementation>

HUMAN OUTCOME:
<what should become possible for the person/team when that problem is handled well>

GENUINE CONSTRAINTS:
<facts that remain true regardless of today's implementation>

EXPERTISE:
<what kind of expert should reason about the problem>

IMAGINATION OBJECT:
"Prompt 1 must independently imagine ______."
```

The IMAGINATION OBJECT should describe the **situation/outcome/problem-solving capability**, not today's artifact form, unless that artifact form is itself explicitly required by the human goal.

For the wider Prompt 0.5, also complete:

```text
ORIGINAL ROADMAP / LARGE-PROJECT GOAL:
<the durable original destination or large-project outcome, not today's completion percentage/status>

GOVERNING ISSUE:
<the issue/capability responsibility that connects the local work to the larger goal>

GOVERNING ISSUE ROLE:
<why this governing issue matters to the large-project outcome>

LOCAL TASK CONTEXT:
<2–5 lines describing the ongoing or last local task's purpose and boundary only; exclude PR/branch/status/current solution detail>

PROGRAMME IMAGINATION OBJECT:
"Prompt 0.5 must independently imagine, from the project level, ______."
```

The PROGRAMME IMAGINATION OBJECT must be broader than the local task but still relevant to the governing issue. It should expose larger value, reframing, missing capability, simplification or project-level assumptions that a task/PR-first reading could miss.

### Example — issue currently written as a register

Bad:

```text
UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM:
keep an excellent register

IMAGINATION OBJECT:
an excellent live register
```

Better only when no stronger concrete witness exists:

```text
UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM:
after substantial work has happened, determine what genuinely remains,
what requires judgement rather than more implementation,
what can proceed independently, what has become historical,
and whether the remaining path is still worth pursuing
```

Stronger when the issue contains a real discriminating case:

```text
PROBLEM WITNESS:
a concrete benchmark / calculation / dependency case that exposes why one unresolved
question changes the value or ordering of the remaining work

INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT:
work that case transparently, identify the actual technical/authority boundary,
then use what was learned to reason about which downstream work is rational
```

Do not prefer abstract programme judgement over a concrete witness that can make the underlying issue understandable.

Prompt 2 may later discover that a live register is a useful solution.

Prompt 1 must not assume that conclusion.

## H. Freeze Prompt 2's REALITY OBJECT

Complete:

```text
REALITY OBJECT:
"Prompt 2 must establish what is actually true today about ______."
```

This may explicitly include the current target artifact, repository, issue history, implementation, PRs, tests, examples, and in-flight work.

Prompt 2 must also establish every live prerequisite needed for the frozen USER INTENT. When the intent includes later action, inspect the current authority, target identity, writable surfaces, linkage conventions, current GitHub/repository state, validation requirements, and any existing object that the action must update or relate to.

Do not execute the final authorized action in Prompt 2 unless the user explicitly defined Prompt 2 itself as the execution step. Its main job remains reality reconstruction.

## I. Freeze Prompt 3's COMPARISON QUESTION — not its artifact form

Complete:

```text
COMPARISON QUESTION:
"After putting the exact Prompt-1 picture beside Prompt-2 reality,
Prompt 3 must determine ______."

ROADMAP SYNTHESIS QUESTION:
"After destination and reality are compared, what should the relevant roadmap/task landscape preserve, revise, narrow, split, replace, add, defer, remove/close, or leave unchanged?"

TECHNICAL PROOF QUESTION:
"What claim-specific falsifier and quantitative or executable proof must be satisfied before any material technical roadmap change or implementation is justified?"

INTENT EXECUTION QUESTION:
"After comparison, how will Prompt 3 fulfill the frozen USER INTENT and AUTHORIZED ACTIONS, or prove why it cannot?"

HANDOVER DESTINATION:
"The next agent must understand ______."
```

Do **not** pre-commit Prompt 3 to producing “a better register,” “a revised matrix,” “an updated roadmap,” or any other improved version of the current artifact.

Prompt 3 must remain free to conclude that the current artifact should be:

- preserved;
- updated;
- narrowed;
- split;
- replaced;
- **added to only when a newly proved gap is not already represented**;
- closed/removed when historical or unnecessary;
- moved back to owning issues;
- deferred;
- or left unchanged.

The response form should emerge **after comparison**, not be decided before it.

Do not draft Prompt 1 until these fields and gates are resolved.

# HARD GATE -2 — SCHEMA FRESHNESS GATE

Before any target reasoning, verify the SCHEMA EXECUTION BASIS.

If the canonical repository/URL is the source:

```text
SCHEMA FETCH STATUS must equal LIVE_THIS_RUN
SCHEMA CONTENT SHA must be populated from that fetch
SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY must equal PASS
```

If this cannot be proven, stop.

Do not generate prompts from remembered schema rules.

---

# HARD GATE -1 — LEGACY-SIGNATURE REJECTION GATE

Before emitting the final artifact, reject any output that:

- makes the current artifact form the Prompt-1 imagination object merely because it exists today;
- narrates repository-blindness or three-pass mechanics inside Prompt 1;
- inserts an extra certification/admission/question stage between the three prompts;
- exposes internal machine/taxonomy fields as visible Q1–Q5 language;
- predetermines in Prompt 3 that the current artifact must survive.

The executable validator owns the exact legacy signature list. Do not reproduce those signatures inside this schema.

---

# HARD GATE 0 — LOT / LEVEL BOUNDARY GATE

Before writing any prompt, compare the resolved target with the user's lot contract.

Ask:

> **Am I still analysing the exact level the user asked for?**

If the user asked for TAB_SURFACE and the target is now a GitHub issue, decision, roadmap, or repository, fail.

If the user asked for ISSUE_TASK and the target has broadened to the whole tab/product/repository, fail.

Do not “improve” the user's decomposition by substituting a supposedly more important target.

---

# HARD GATE 0.5 — SPECIFICITY-FLOOR GATE

Prompt 1 must be independent, but it must not become generic consultancy prose.

Ask all of these:

> **Could this Prompt 1 be pasted unchanged into ten unrelated projects in the same industry?**

> **Could a competent general manager answer most of it without knowing this target domain?**

> **Would the user recognise the exact requested level and job-to-be-done from Prompt 1 even though today's implementation is hidden?**

If the first two are yes, or the third is no, Prompt 1 is too generic.

A good Prompt 1 normally contains:

- a concrete person;
- a concrete job or decision;
- a concrete real-world scenario;
- target-specific domain objects/inputs/results;
- genuine target constraints;
- target-specific failure/trust questions.

It should be **specific to the target, independent of today's answer**.

For ISSUE_TASK, genericness is not cured by adding more abstract questions. It is cured by restoring the PROBLEM KERNEL.

---

# HARD GATE 0.75 — SAME-ISSUE IDENTITY GATE

For ISSUE_TASK only, remove the issue number/title from Prompt 1 and ask:

> **Could a domain-aware person familiar with the programme distinguish this issue from its sibling issues?**

They do not need to guess the exact GitHub number.

But they should be able to say what *particular unresolved problem* this prompt is about.

If Prompt 1 collapses to something like:

- “how should engineering decisions be made?”;
- “how should a register work?”;
- “how should qualification be governed?”;
- “how should a learner system map knowledge?”;

without the identity-bearing tension of the issue, fail.

The fix is **not** to restore today's solution.

The fix is to restore the PROBLEM KERNEL.

---

# HARD GATE 0.8 — TASK-CONTRACT FIDELITY GATE

For ISSUE_TASK, inspect every field of the ISSUE TASK CONTRACT.

Ask:

> **Is Prompt 1 materially situated in this exact assignment, or has it abstracted upward into a generic class of work?**

Prompt 1 must preserve:

- WHY NOW;
- the load-bearing STARTING PREMISE;
- RESPONSIBLE ACTOR / JOB;
- OWNED QUESTION;
- relevant NON-GOALS / OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY.

If these disappear, fail.

Do not replace them with generic words such as "complex programme", "responsible owner", or "remaining work" when the issue gives a more specific assignment.

---

# HARD GATE 0.82 — NEIGHBOUR-SEPARATION GATE

For ISSUE_TASK, compare Prompt 1 with the parent and nearest sibling issues.

Ask:

> **Could this Prompt 1 be used unchanged for the parent issue or a nearby sibling?**

If yes, it is too broad.

Use ISSUE DIFFERENTIATOR to restore the exact edge.

For example, an issue-level prompt must remain distinguishable from its parent audit, a sibling authority decision, and downstream release-execution work.

---

# HARD GATE 0.83 — PROBLEM-WITNESS SELECTION GATE

For ISSUE_TASK, ask:

> **Does the target contain a concrete benchmark, case, trace, example, dataset, drawing, observed output, user journey, dependency case, or other witness that materially exposes the owned question?**

If yes:

- select it explicitly;
- retain enough real payload to let the future agent work it;
- do not replace real values with invented plausible values;
- require a concrete INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT from it.

If a strong witness exists and Prompt 1 ignores it in favour of abstract consultancy questions, fail.

If no usable witness exists, record:

```text
PROBLEM WITNESS TYPE: NONE
```

and proceed from the task contract/kernel.

---

# HARD GATE 0.84 — WITNESS-INDEPENDENCE GATE

If Prompt 1 uses a witness, separate:

```text
raw/input/source facts
reported outputs to reproduce
today's interpretation/recommendation
```

Prompt 1 may provide the first two.

The second must be framed as:

> reproduce, verify, explain, or falsify this reported result

—not:

> accept this result and reason from its conclusion.

The third remains quarantined.

Fail if the witness merely launders today's recommendation into Prompt 1.

---

# HARD GATE 0.85 — KERNEL-COVERAGE GATE

For ISSUE_TASK, inspect every PROBLEM KERNEL fact.

Ask:

> **Is this fact materially present in Prompt 1, either explicitly or naturally in the scenario?**

Every load-bearing kernel fact must survive.

If any kernel fact disappears, Prompt 1 is drifting toward generic class-level advice.

Do not repair missing identity by adding today's answer.
Restore only the missing kernel fact.

---

# HARD GATE 0.9 — ANSWER-EXCLUSION GATE

For ISSUE_TASK, inspect every CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE item.

Ask:

> **Can a reader learn or reconstruct this quarantined fact from Prompt 1?**

If yes, Prompt 1 is contaminated.

Examples of quarantined leakage:

```text
today's option set
today's chosen numerical rule
current benchmark percentage
current study/sample conclusion
current exact PR order
current blocker/decision inventory
current matrix/rung names
current proposed file/schema changes
```

Prompt 1 should expose the **question worth answering**, not today's repository answer.

Do not merely replace leaked proper nouns with generic nouns.
Remove the answer-side fact.

---

# HARD GATE 0.95 — ISSUE GOLDILOCKS CORRIDOR

An issue-level Prompt 1 passes only if **both** are true:

```text
KERNEL-COMPLETE:
The load-bearing PROBLEM KERNEL survives.

RECOGNISABLE:
The underlying issue is identifiable from that kernel.

ANSWER-EXCLUDED:
CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE does not leak.

NOT PRE-SOLVED:
The current answer/options/evidence interpretation cannot be reconstructed.
```

Think of the allowed information band as:

```text
too generic
    ↓
[ task contract + problem kernel + concrete witness + domain truth + human outcome ]
    ↑
too contaminated
```

The generator's job is to stay inside that band.

---

# HARD GATE 0.965 — HUMAN-Q-LABEL GATE

When COMPLEX MODE is ON and visible Q1–Q5 headings are used, inspect each heading and the text immediately beneath it.

Fail if the visible surface uses internal taxonomy identifiers, machine-field names, schema metadata, or protocol syntax.

Passing labels must be short, natural, target-specific practitioner language.

For example:

```text
Q1 — Work out what is happening in this real case
Q2 — Do the calculation or reconstruction yourself
Q3 — Change the case and see what breaks
Q4 — Check your result by an independent route
Q5 — Given what you learned, what is worth doing next?
```

If the user did not ask to see Q1–Q5 labels, prefer natural prose and do not show labels at all.

---

# HARD GATE 0.966 — PROMPT-1 REPOSITORY-IDENTITY GATE

Prompt 1 must not reveal or discuss the repository identity.

Compute conceptually:

```text
PROMPT_1_REPOSITORY_LEAK_SCORE =
    repository URL/path occurrences
  + owner/repository slug occurrences
  + exact repository-name occurrences
  + repository-deferral/meta phrases

Required result:
0
```

This applies even when the repository identity appears inside a prohibition.

Fail examples:

```text
"Do not inspect owner/repo."
"Do not refer to the repository."
"Without opening the repo..."
"Ignore the current GitHub repository..."
```

Those phrases still expose the method and repository context.

Prompt 1 must live entirely inside the human/domain problem. Repository identity and inspection mechanics belong to Prompt 2.

The product/domain name may still appear when it is a genuine human-facing identity independent of the repository name.

---

# HARD GATE 0.97 — HUMAN-IMMERSION GATE

Read Prompt 1 as though you were the future agent receiving it with no knowledge of this schema.

Fail if Prompt 1 contains process/meta language about:

- pass sequencing;
- later comparison mechanics;
- repository or issue-access restrictions;
- schema/preflight/gate/quarantine terminology;
- preserving an answer for a future stage.

Also fail if the opening spends more time explaining how to think than describing the person, job, domain situation, real object/case, and stakes.

A passing Prompt 1 should begin inside the human/domain problem, not outside it.

The blindness mechanism must be invisible to the future agent.

---

# HARD GATE 0.98 — INTENT-FIDELITY GATE

Read all three prompts together.

Ask:

> **If a capable agent followed these three prompts exactly, would the user's stated operational intent actually be completed?**

Fail when:

- an `ANALYZE_THEN_ACT` request becomes analysis/recommendation only;
- an explicitly authorized repository/GitHub action disappears from Prompt 3;
- Prompt 3 says what should be done but does not instruct the agent to do it;
- Prompt 2 fails to inspect prerequisites needed for the intended action;
- the prompts substitute a different action because it seems more interesting;
- the action expands beyond the user's authorization boundary.

Passing behavior:

```text
understand independently
→ inspect live prerequisites
→ revalidate
→ execute the authorized justified action
→ verify/read back the result
→ report what happened and what remains
```

When the action cannot legitimately be completed, Prompt 3 must require a precise blocking explanation tied to evidence, authority or capability.

This gate protects **intent**, not any predetermined technical solution.

---

# HARD GATE 1 — ARTIFACT-ERASURE GATE

Imagine that the current issue, register, roadmap, matrix, architecture, checklist, implementation and proposed solution never existed.

Keep only:

- the human problem;
- desired outcome;
- genuine constraints;
- domain;
- scale.

Ask:

> **Would Prompt 1 still make essentially the same sense?**

If no, Prompt 1 has inherited the current answer.

Reject it and rewrite.

Important nuance:

- For a product target, the product category may itself be part of the human request. “Browser PDF editor” can survive erasure of the **current implementation**.
- For ISSUE_TASK, erase the **artifact form and current answer**, but preserve the ISSUE TASK CONTRACT. Imagine the Markdown issue/register disappeared while the assignment it represents remained.
- For an issue currently expressed as a “register,” “matrix,” or “roadmap,” that artifact form usually should **not** survive unless the task contract explicitly requires that form.

---

# HARD GATE 2 — CURRENT-VOCABULARY LEAKAGE GATE

Scan Prompt 1 noun-by-noun and fact-by-fact.

For every important term, ask:

```text
Did this come from:

A. the blind human problem / genuine domain constraint

or

B. the current target / repository / issue / implementation / proposed solution?
```

If B, remove it unless it is explicitly classified as either:

- ISSUE TASK CONTRACT / PROBLEM KERNEL material for ISSUE_TASK; or
- a genuine independent domain/human constraint.

For issue-level work, deleting all target-derived facts is a failure: it erases the assignment itself.

Hiding the issue number while paraphrasing its current state is **not** blindness.

Likewise, replacing target-specific proper nouns with generic nouns is not enough.

If the narrative structure and current evidence story are preserved while only names are anonymised, the answer has merely been **laundered into generic language**.

For ISSUE_TASK, preserve the PROBLEM KERNEL directly and remove the current answer instead of anonymising both.

A Prompt 1 that says:

```text
recently landed work
in-flight work
infrastructure blockers
owner-reserved decisions
one living register
stale written plans
```

because those facts came from today's issue is contaminated even if no repository name appears.

---

# HARD GATE 3 — PROMPT-1 OBJECT GATE

Finish:

> **“If Prompt 1 were answered perfectly, the answer would give us an independent picture of ______.”**

The blank must match the frozen IMAGINATION OBJECT and help solve the UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM.

If it instead describes:

- a larger neighbouring product;
- a current artifact form;
- a specific implementation proposal;
- or a smaller symptom;

reject Prompt 1.

---

# HARD GATE 4 — PROMPT-3 FREEDOM GATE

Read Prompt 3 before output.

Ask:

> **Can the agent still conclude, based on evidence, that today's artifact should be preserved, changed, narrowed, split, replaced, added to, closed, deferred, moved elsewhere, or left alone?**

Fail if Prompt 3 mandates a better version of today's artifact before comparison is complete.

Prompt 3 may require a decision and reasoning, but must not pre-decide the survival of the current solution form.

---

# HARD GATE 4.1 — PROMPT-3 CONTEXT / STEP-BACK GATE

Prompt 3 must not invent missing Prompt-1 or Prompt-2 results.

It must require the future agent to use the actual outputs, retrieve durable references when available, or explicitly regenerate a missing pass from its original inputs before reconciliation.

Prompt 1 must be treated as an **independent baseline, not immutable truth**.

For targets inside a programme, repository, product roadmap, task graph or issue family, Prompt 3 must then widen context without widening ownership.

It must make the future agent:

- recover the actual Prompt-1 independent baseline;
- inspect the relevant larger capability/roadmap landscape;
- distinguish completed, active, deferred and neighbouring work;
- preserve ownership boundaries;
- treat the roadmap/task model as a revisable hypothesis rather than the destination.

Fail if Prompt 3 lets PR statistics, commit counts, changed-file counts, branch ahead/behind numbers, CI-run counts, test counts or percentage-complete determine product/system direction.

> **STEP BACK widens understanding, not ownership.**

---

# HARD GATE 4.2 — PROMPT-3 RECONCILIATION / GAP-INDEPENDENCE GATE

Prompt 3 must reconcile:

```text
PROMPT-0.5 PROGRAMME-LEVEL INDEPENDENT PICTURE
×
PROMPT-1 INDEPENDENT BASELINE
×
PROMPT-2 VERIFIED REALITY
×
PROMPT-2.5 INTEGRATED SYNTHESIS
×
CURRENT ROADMAP / TASK MODEL
```

It must not define reconciliation as making those representations agree. Any of the three may need revision.

Before inherited solution candidates are allowed to influence the answer, Prompt 3 must require a **solution-neutral independent current-gap statement**.

Historical candidates from an issue, roadmap, handover or prior agent output must be treated as hypotheses to test against that independently discovered gap, not as a next-work queue.

Require the future agent to expose contradictions, already-solved work, Prompt-1 assumptions defeated by reality, stale roadmap assumptions, ownership mismatches, genuinely missing capabilities and evidence gaps.

> **RECONCILE does not mean harmonize.**

---

# HARD GATE 4.3 — PROMPT-3 TECHNICAL-CRITIQUE / PROOF GATE

For every material technical conclusion that would cause an `ADD`, `REVISE`, `SPLIT`, `REPLACE` or implementation change, Prompt 3 must demand a **claim-specific proof obligation before capability scope is admitted**.

The proof obligation must distinguish:

```text
claim / invariant
gap witness
current observation
required observation
existing-model-first attempt
disproof condition
measurement or executable oracle
after-change proof
regression / invariant check
pressure test when generality is claimed
```

The **gap witness** is the case that can expose the alleged deficiency.

The **disproof condition** is the result that would prove the proposed architecture/capability unnecessary, mis-scoped or incorrectly owned.

Quantitative proof is mandatory when the claimed property is meaningfully quantitative. When it is not, require a reproducible executable oracle rather than invented numbers.

The future agent must explicitly try to prove the proposed change unnecessary by attempting the stronger case with the existing model first.

If the current system satisfies the witness and the disproof condition is met without the proposed addition, Prompt 3 must require the proposal to be withdrawn or narrowed.

If the claim cannot yet be measured or executed, it may justify a bounded **PROBE / EVIDENCE TASK**, but the hypothesized product capability must not be counted as admitted scope merely because investigation was admitted.

Do not accept LOC, commit count, PR count, issue count, number of tests, CI-run count or percentage-complete as proof of technical value.

> **CRITIQUE THE CLAIM means try to disprove it.**

---

# HARD GATE 4.4 — PROMPT-3 DECISION / EVIDENCE-SYMMETRY GATE

Prompt 3 must postpone disposition until after step-back, reconciliation and technical critique.

The final decision space must remain capable of:

```text
PRESERVE
REVISE
NARROW
SPLIT
REPLACE
ADD
DEFER
REMOVE / CLOSE
LEAVE UNCHANGED
```

Evidence is required in both directions:

- additions/architecture changes require a proved deficiency;
- narrowing/removal/closure/ownership transfer require positive evidence that the obligation is satisfied, invalid, superseded, incorrectly owned or unnecessary;
- preservation requires evidence that the current boundary still serves the destination.

The prompt must permit a probe/evidence task, fixture/proof strengthening, ownership transfer or no change instead of forcing implementation.

Delivery mechanics come after this decision.

---

# STEP 0.5 — BUILD PROMPT 0.5 FROM THE PROGRAMME-LEVEL BLIND REFERENCE

Prompt 0.5 is the first independent-thinking pass and deliberately works at a wider aperture than Prompt 1.

Allowed inputs to Prompt 0.5:

```text
ORIGINAL ROADMAP / LARGE-PROJECT GOAL
GOVERNING ISSUE
GOVERNING ISSUE ROLE
LOCAL TASK CONTEXT — purpose/scope only, 2–5 lines
HUMAN OUTCOME
GENUINE CONSTRAINTS
domain facts independent of today's implementation
PROGRAMME IMAGINATION OBJECT
```

Forbidden inputs to Prompt 0.5 unless independently justified as genuine constraints:

```text
current PR/branch state
current task status
commit counts / changed-file counts / CI telemetry
current implementation
current proposed answer
current acceptance checklist
current work sequence
present blockers
current roadmap status/progress
repository architecture or internal abstraction names
```

Prompt 0.5 must form a broad independent opinion about what the project → governing-issue → local-task chain should make possible before meeting today's answer.

---

# STEP 1 — BUILD PROMPT 1 ONLY FROM THE BLIND REFERENCE

This is the most important construction rule.

Allowed inputs to Prompt 1:

```text
PROGRAMME-LEVEL INDEPENDENT PICTURE distilled from Prompt 0.5
GOVERNING ISSUE and GOVERNING ISSUE ROLE
LOCAL TASK CONTEXT — purpose/scope only
USER-REQUESTED LEVEL
TARGET TITLE / SURFACE when it is itself part of the requested human problem
TARGET ANCHORS
ISSUE TASK CONTRACT for ISSUE_TASK
PROBLEM KERNEL
PROBLEM WITNESS for ISSUE_TASK when one exists
INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT for ISSUE_TASK when a witness is selected
UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM
HUMAN OUTCOME
GENUINE CONSTRAINTS
EXPERTISE
IMAGINATION OBJECT
domain facts that are genuinely independent of the current implementation
```

Forbidden inputs to Prompt 1 unless independently justified as genuine constraints:

```text
CURRENT ARTIFACT FORM
CURRENT STATED ANSWER / IMPLEMENTATION
CURRENT-STATE FACTS
CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE
repository structure
existing abstraction names
current schemas
current architecture
issue checklist
current roadmap
file names
PR numbers
present blockers
current decision list
current solution vocabulary
```

The purpose is to let the future agent **have an opinion before meeting today's answer**.

Prompt 0.5 supplies the wider project-level independent picture. Prompt 1 must narrow from that picture into the governing issue and local task rather than restarting from the latest PR/task status.

For task/issue targets, recover the human intention underneath the work item.

Examples:

```text
"Add three matrix rungs and capability mappings"
→ not "imagine an excellent matrix"
→ imagine how a learner stuck on a real question should be connected
   to reusable knowledge, prerequisites and teaching

"Maintain this open-items register"
→ not "imagine an excellent register"
→ imagine how a competent successor should determine what genuinely remains,
   what is decision versus executable work, and what should happen next

"Fix 900-page scrolling"
→ not "imagine a 900-page mode"
→ imagine what working with a very large document should feel like and
   what must remain responsive
```

The generator itself enforces blindness by controlling what information is allowed into Prompt 1.

**Do not make Prompt 1 talk about that enforcement.**

# PROMPT 0.5 — IMAGINE FROM PROGRAMME

Generate a self-contained **independent-thinking prompt at the broader project level**.

Prompt 0.5 must reason in this order:

```text
ORIGINAL ROADMAP / LARGE-PROJECT GOAL
→ GOVERNING ISSUE in service of that goal
→ ONGOING OR LAST LOCAL TASK as only a short subordinate slice
```

The ordering is mandatory. The local task is context, not the destination.

Prompt 0.5 must be generated from the blind reference, not from current PR/task status or implementation choices. Give the future agent enough stable context to understand the original project destination, the governing issue's responsibility, and a 2–5 line description of the local task's purpose. Do not give branch/PR status, current solution details, current acceptance checklist, current work sequence, or inherited proposed answer.

Make the future agent think independently about the **larger value** of this chain. It should ask, in project/domain language:

- If the large-project goal were served exceptionally well, what capability or human outcome would exist?
- What must the governing issue contribute to that destination, regardless of today's local implementation?
- What important opportunity, missing capability, simplification, risk, or wrong assumption may be invisible when attention starts from the latest task?
- Is the local task actually the right expression of the governing issue's need, or only one possible instrument?
- What would a strong successor notice from the project level that someone staring at the latest PR could miss?
- What project-level hypothesis is worth carrying down into the issue-level Prompt 1?

Prompt 0.5 must end with a concise **PROGRAMME-LEVEL INDEPENDENT PICTURE** containing:
- the large-project outcome that matters;
- the governing issue's role in achieving it;
- 2–4 non-obvious project/issue-level value hypotheses or reframings;
- the local task in only a few lines, explicitly subordinate to those larger goals;
- assumptions or questions that Prompt 1 should examine at tighter resolution.

Prompt 0.5 is imaginative and independent. It is not a repository-status report, PR summary, or factual orientation pass.

---

# PROMPT 1 — IMAGINE

Generate a self-contained first-principles prompt from the **BLIND REFERENCE only**.

Prompt 1 is the **more local independent-thinking pass**. Start from the governing issue, then reason down into the local task / concrete witness. Use Prompt 0.5's broader project-level hypotheses as context to challenge the local framing, but do not convert Prompt 1 into a project-wide redesign.

It should begin from the strongest available concrete footing:

- for ISSUE_TASK with a usable PROBLEM WITNESS: the real case/object and the practitioner who must work it;
- otherwise: the underlying human problem;
- the intended human outcome;
- genuine constraints;
- relevant domain realities;
- the required expertise.

When a witness exists, prefer verbs such as:

```text
calculate
derive
reconstruct
trace
compare
reproduce
falsify
explain
work the case
```

over:

```text
consider
discuss
imagine principles
think about
```

Prompt 1 should make the future agent **do the substantive work** that reveals the issue.

Prompt 1 must **not mention** repositories, issue trackers, later passes, blind/reference mechanics, schema rules, or instructions about what the agent is forbidden to inspect.

Those are generator-side controls, not part of the human prompt.

Use human language and mental simulation.

### Blind does not mean generic

Prompt 1 should be concrete enough that the user can immediately tell whether it is:

- issue-level;
- tab/surface-level;
- product-level;
- or repository/system-level.

For TAB_SURFACE, normally walk a real user through the surface from arrival/input to result/refusal/review.

For ISSUE_TASK, stay on the specific underlying issue problem and its lifecycle stage; do not drift to the whole tab.

Use TARGET ANCHORS aggressively enough to make the scenario vivid, while keeping current-answer facts quarantined.

### Human-immersion rule

Prompt 1 should feel as though a strong practitioner has been dropped directly into the real situation.

Prefer this shape:

```text
who is the person?
→ what are they trying to accomplish?
→ what real thing is in front of them?
→ what makes this case difficult or consequential?
→ what would they need to understand, calculate, decide, trust, notice, or prove?
→ what would good handling make possible?
```

The reader should forget that a three-pass method exists.

Do not narrate:

- pass sequencing;
- future comparison mechanics;
- repository/issue-access restrictions;
- schema/preflight/gate terminology;
- instructions about preserving an answer for a later stage.

Do not begin with procedural advice about how to think.

Cause first-principles reasoning through the real situation, concrete object and questions.

### Prompt 1 must end in a human picture of success

At the end, ask naturally for something equivalent to:

> **“If this were handled really well, what would become possible for the person doing the work?”**

Then ask what would make that outcome trustworthy, durable, or worth defending.

Do not mention that the answer will become a reference for another pass. The generator retains that relationship internally.

### Complex-mode addition

If COMPLEX MODE is ON, Prompt 1 must naturally cover all five Q1–Q5 reasoning lenses from Appendix H.

Do **not** write robotic headings such as:

```text
Q1:
Q2:
Q3:
Q4:
Q5:
```

unless the user explicitly asks to see those labels.

Instead weave the five lenses into the human scenario so they feel like the natural questions a strong practitioner would ask.

### Product-level note

At product level, the product category itself can be part of the human goal. Prompt 1 may therefore imagine the desired product experience broadly.

What remains forbidden is leaking the **current product implementation**.

### Repository/system-level note

Imagine the desired human/system outcome independent of today's repository architecture, roadmap, phase names and implementation vocabulary.

### Tab/surface-level note

Imagine the real user using that named surface end to end.

Prompt 1 should normally cover:

```text
real starting situation
→ inputs / choices
→ interpretation / calculation / transformation
→ result or refusal
→ understanding of applicability
→ review / evidence / next action
```

Use the tab's genuine domain purpose and user job.

Do not leak today's UI arrangement, bug list, implementation limits or current backlog.

### Task/issue-level note

Issue-level Prompt 1 should be **closer to the issue than to the parent programme**.

Do not start by abstracting upward to a generic human problem.

Start with the ISSUE TASK CONTRACT.

Construct Prompt 1 in this order:

```text
1. Put the RESPONSIBLE ACTOR into the exact WHY-NOW situation.
2. State the STARTING PREMISE as a scenario, not as verified reality.
3. Make the OWNED QUESTION unmistakable.
4. State the NON-GOALS / OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY where it matters.
5. Carry the PROBLEM KERNEL concretely.
6. If a PROBLEM WITNESS exists, give the future agent the real case/payload and require
   the INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT before asking for broader judgement.
7. Make reported witness outputs claims to reproduce/falsify, not accepted conclusions.
8. Ask first-principles questions that emerge from what the witness teaches.
9. Return explicitly to the OWNED QUESTION.
10. End with the human/domain outcome.
```

The actor is the person responsible for **this issue's outcome**.

Do not automatically substitute the product end-user.

For a coordination/closure issue, the right actor may be the engineering owner or successor deciding what truly remains.

For a user-facing defect issue, the end-user may be appropriate.

Do not begin by asking for the current artifact:

```text
bad:  "Imagine an excellent decision package."
bad:  "Imagine an excellent register."
bad:  "Imagine an excellent matrix."
```

Instead ask about the actual unresolved problem:

```text
better:
"You are responsible for a professional engineering capability whose governing method
directly supports some cases but not the real case now in front of you. The source does
not provide the missing extension rule. Work the case far enough to show exactly where
the governed method ends, what additional assumption would be needed to continue, and
what evidence would be required before an organisation could responsibly rely on that extension."
```

That is issue-specific in structure without revealing today's options or evidence conclusion.

Do **not** assume the current issue's proposed artifact or work breakdown is the correct instrument.

Run the TASK-CONTRACT FIDELITY, NEIGHBOUR-SEPARATION,
PROBLEM-WITNESS SELECTION, WITNESS-INDEPENDENCE, KERNEL-COVERAGE,
SAME-ISSUE IDENTITY, ANSWER-EXCLUSION, ARTIFACT-ERASURE,
CURRENT-VOCABULARY and PROMPT-1 OBJECT gates before accepting Prompt 1.

---

# STEP 2 — PROMPT 2 MUST RECONSTRUCT REALITY, NOT REDESIGN IT

Prompt 2 now deliberately brings back everything quarantined from Prompt 1: the exact target artifact, its current answer, implementation vocabulary, history, repository, tests, PRs and live state.

Its subject is the frozen **REALITY OBJECT**.

Tell the future agent to inspect the live implementation and understand the reality relevant to that object before proposing changes. Do not automatically broaden Prompt 2 into a full repository audit if the target only needs a bounded register, decision, investigation, or implementation reality.

Depending on the target, inspect relevant:

- repository code and data;
- README and architecture documents;
- tests;
- issue history;
- PR history;
- current open PRs;
- recent merged work;
- current roadmap;
- real examples, real failures, real questions, real documents, or real usage evidence.

Tell it not to rely only on documentation or issue prose when actual code or data can answer the question.

Tell it to follow **real journeys appropriate to the target's purpose**, not merely list folders.

Examples:

```text
user intent
→ action
→ system decisions
→ result
```

```text
real question/problem
→ interpretation
→ underlying need
→ route through the system
→ outcome
```

```text
open document
→ load
→ interact
→ modify
→ save
```

For coordination/register work, Prompt 2 should trace claims such as:

```text
register statement
→ live issue / PR / branch / test / workflow / decision
→ still true, stale, superseded, blocked, or unresolved
```

For decision work, trace:

```text
decision to be made
→ alternatives
→ evidence
→ uncertainty
→ consequence of each choice
→ authority boundary
```

For investigation work, trace:

```text
claim or symptom
→ evidence source
→ reproduction
→ competing explanations
→ conclusion and remaining uncertainty
```

For handover work, trace:

```text
what successor is told
→ source of truth
→ current validity
→ first safe action
→ stale condition
```

Prompt 2 should encourage the agent to discover:

- what is already genuinely strong;
- what is incomplete;
- what exists only in documentation;
- what is intentionally absent;
- what has become obsolete;
- what has been superseded;
- what real examples have exposed;
- what current work is already trying to solve.

### Present baseline and near-future baseline

When relevant PRs or in-flight work exist, Prompt 2 must distinguish:

```text
CURRENT BASELINE
what is actually true now

NEAR-FUTURE BASELINE
what would be true if the clearly relevant current work lands
```

This prevents the future agent from proposing work another agent is already completing.

Do not let Prompt 2 become the redesign step.

Its closing job is to explain, in plain language:

> “This is what the system has actually become.”

---

# STEP 2.5 — PROMPT 2.5 MUST RECONCILE REALITY AND DIRECTION

Prompt 2.5 is an integrated bridge. It deliberately combines the essential intent of Prompt 2 and Prompt 3 without replacing either one.

It must:
- use the actual Prompt-0.5 orientation, Prompt-1 independent picture and Prompt-2 reality reconstruction;
- re-read or re-check the live repository/issue/PR/evidence state needed for any material conclusion, so it does not reconcile against stale Prompt-2 facts;
- compare the independent picture with verified reality and the programme/roadmap hierarchy;
- state the **independent current gap** before selecting inherited solution candidates;
- distinguish capability gaps from delivery, evidence, ownership, sequencing or no-action conditions;
- test inherited issue/roadmap/PR proposals as hypotheses rather than treating them as a queue;
- identify the evidence-supported direction that Prompt 3 should revalidate and, when authorized, execute;
- leave final external/repository action and terminal handover to Prompt 3 unless the user explicitly defines Prompt 2.5 itself as an execution step.

Prompt 2.5 must therefore contain both:
1. fresh-enough reality reconstruction; and
2. baseline × reality × roadmap reconciliation.

Its closing output should include:

```text
PROGRAMME-LEVEL INDEPENDENT PICTURE
VERIFIED REALITY REFRESH
INDEPENDENT CURRENT GAP
CANDIDATES TESTED
EVIDENCE-SUPPORTED DIRECTION
DISPROOF / CHANGE-MIND CONDITIONS
WHAT PROMPT 3 MUST REVALIDATE
```

---

# STEP 3 — PROMPT 3 MUST REUSE THE EXACT PASS-1 IDEAL

Prompt 3 must also be **self-identifying**.

At its top, include the concrete target references again:

```text
TARGET:
<issue/task/product/repository name>

TARGET LINK:
<canonical issue/task/PR/document URL when available>

REPOSITORY / SYSTEM:
<repository or parent system name when applicable>

REPOSITORY LINK:
<repository URL when available>

USER INTENT:
<the frozen operational intent>

AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:
<the frozen authorized action set>
```

Do not assume the agent running Prompt 3 still has access to the original user message.

If the target is an issue inside a repository, Prompt 3 should normally contain **both**:

- the issue URL;
- the repository URL.

If the target is the repository itself, one repository URL is enough.

If the target has no URL, use the clearest stable identifier available.



Prompt 3 must explicitly tell the future agent to return to the **actual Prompt-0.5, Prompt-1, Prompt-2 and Prompt-2.5 outputs**.

Do not let it quietly rewrite the ideal after seeing the repository.

Tell it:

> Recover the programme hierarchy from Prompt 0.5 and the independent picture from Prompt 1.

> Put them beside the reality you discovered in Prompt 2 and the integrated synthesis from Prompt 2.5.

> Where evidence from reality genuinely changed your mind, explain exactly why.

> Otherwise keep the original independent baseline.

This is the anti-goalpost-moving rule.

If the five prompts are likely to be run in separate conversations, Prompt 3 should instruct the user to paste or attach the outputs of Prompt 0.5, Prompt 1, Prompt 2 and Prompt 2.5 before running it. If they are expected to run in one continuous conversation, simply tell the agent to use its prior four outputs.

The Prompt-0.5, Prompt-1, Prompt-2 and Prompt-2.5 outputs are supporting context; they do **not** replace the target identity and links.

---

# PROMPT 3 — REVALIDATE AND MOVE FORWARD

Prompt 3 must use the **actual Prompt-0.5 programme-level independent picture, Prompt-1 independent result, Prompt-2 verified reality and Prompt-2.5 integrated synthesis**.

Prompt 1 is deliberately independent, but it is not infallible. Verified reality or a stronger falsifier may show that one of its assumptions should change.

Prompt 3 is constrained by the frozen **COMPARISON QUESTION** and **USER INTENT**, not by a preselected artifact form.

Artifact freedom does not mean intent freedom.

If the user explicitly requested `ANALYZE_THEN_ACT` or `EXECUTE_DEFINED_ACTION`, Prompt 3 must proceed from conclusion to the authorized action when justified. It may adapt implementation details to verified reality, but it must not downgrade execution into recommendation-only prose.

For repository/GitHub actions, Prompt 3 should require:

```text
prepare the smallest justified change/action
→ perform it
→ read back/verify actual external or repository state
→ report identifiers/links/evidence
→ state anything still unresolved
```

Tell the future agent explicitly:

> Use Prompt 1 as the independent reference picture, not as an infallible specification.

> Put it beside the programme hierarchy from Prompt 0.5, the verified reality established in Prompt 2, and the evidence-supported direction produced in Prompt 2.5.

> Where evidence genuinely changes either picture, say exactly why.

> Do not assume the current issue, register, matrix, roadmap, architecture, checklist, candidate-work list or task breakdown deserves to survive merely because it already exists.

Prompt 3 should use the following **visible reasoning pivots**. The keywords are deliberate mode changes, not decorative headings:

```text
RETURN TO DESTINATION
        ↓
STEP BACK
        ↓
RECONCILE
        ↓
CRITIQUE THE CLAIM
        ↓
DECIDE
        ↓
EXECUTE IF AUTHORIZED
```

The four pivots mean different things. Do not collapse them into generic "think critically" prose.

## A. CONTEXT INTEGRITY / RETURN TO DESTINATION

Before reasoning from Prompt 1 or Prompt 2, verify that their actual outputs are available.

Use this order:

1. use the actual Prompt-0.5, Prompt-1, Prompt-2 and Prompt-2.5 outputs from the current three-pass execution when present;
2. otherwise retrieve their durable published artifacts/references when available;
3. if any result is unavailable, regenerate only that missing prompt from its original inputs and explicitly state that it was regenerated;
4. never silently substitute the historical issue, roadmap, current implementation or the agent's recollection for a missing Prompt-0.5/Prompt-1/Prompt-2/Prompt-2.5 result.

Then recover the Prompt-1 destination.

Ask:

> What were we trying to make possible before today's implementation, issue text, PR state and candidate-work list were allowed to shape the answer?

Treat that answer as the **independent baseline**.

Do not rewrite it merely to resemble the repository.

Do not preserve it merely because Prompt 1 said it. If verified reality or a stronger falsifier defeats one of its assumptions, revise that assumption explicitly and explain the evidence.

> **Prompt 1 is the independent baseline, not immutable truth.**

## B. STEP BACK — widen understanding, not ownership

Before choosing the next task or technical solution, step back from the immediate issue, PR, branch, current implementation and inherited candidate list.

Inspect the **relevant larger capability and roadmap landscape**:

- the Prompt-1 independent baseline;
- what Prompt 2 proved already exists;
- relevant roadmap themes and task decomposition;
- completed, active, deferred and neighbouring capabilities;
- ownership boundaries and dependencies;
- historical ideas that may already be obsolete or superseded.

Treat the roadmap/task system as a **hypothesis about how to reach the destination**, not as the definition of the destination.

Use neighbouring work to understand the system. Do not absorb neighbouring ownership merely because you inspected it.

> **STEP BACK widens understanding, not ownership.**

Do not let repository/PR telemetry become a capability model. PR state, branch divergence, commit count, changed-file count, CI-run count, test-file count or percentage-complete may locate evidence or constrain delivery, but they do not establish what the system should become.

## C. RECONCILE — baseline × reality × roadmap

Now reconcile:

```text
PROMPT-0.5 PROGRAMME-LEVEL INDEPENDENT PICTURE
×
PROMPT-1 INDEPENDENT BASELINE
×
PROMPT-2 VERIFIED REALITY
×
PROMPT-2.5 INTEGRATED SYNTHESIS
×
CURRENT ROADMAP / TASK MODEL
```

Reconciliation does **not** mean forcing these three pictures to agree.

Any of the three may need to change.

Explain the important differences and determine which representation should change.

Identify:

- capabilities already good enough and not worth reopening;
- meaningful destination gaps that remain;
- Prompt-1 assumptions invalidated by verified reality;
- roadmap items whose wording, scope or ownership no longer matches reality;
- tasks already made obsolete by later work;
- work that belongs to another owner;
- uncertainty caused by missing evidence rather than by missing architecture.

### Independent current-gap statement

Before reading, selecting or ranking inherited solution candidates, write a solution-neutral statement:

> **Given the independent baseline and verified reality, the meaningful current gap is...**

or, when appropriate:

> **No material capability gap is currently proved; the remaining need is evidence / delivery / ownership / no action.**

This statement must be derived **before** inherited candidate architectures are allowed to shape the answer.

Only after the independent current-gap statement exists may Prompt 3 inspect historical candidate ideas from the issue, roadmap, handover or prior agent output.

Treat those candidates as hypotheses to test against the independently discovered gap, **not as a next-work queue**.

A candidate may be rejected, narrowed, transferred, deferred or made obsolete by the reconciliation.

For each material roadmap/capability item, the eventual disposition may be:

```text
PRESERVE
REVISE
NARROW
SPLIT
REPLACE
ADD
DEFER
REMOVE / CLOSE
LEAVE UNCHANGED
```

Do not make the disposition yet merely because one sounds plausible. Material changes must survive **CRITIQUE THE CLAIM**.

> **RECONCILE does not mean harmonize. It means expose the contradiction, state the gap independently, and determine what should change.**

## D. CRITIQUE THE CLAIM — try to prove the proposed change unnecessary

Do not accept architectural prose as proof.

Critique **every material technical conclusion**, including the agent's own new idea.

The default challenge is:

> **Try to prove the proposed change unnecessary. First attempt the stronger case using the existing model.**

For every technical conclusion that would materially change roadmap scope or implementation, establish:

```text
CLAIM / INVARIANT
What exact system property is claimed to be missing or wrong?

GAP WITNESS
What concrete input, operation, case or state transition would expose the alleged deficiency?

CURRENT OBSERVATION
What does the live system actually produce for that witness?

REQUIRED OBSERVATION
What must a sufficient system produce?

EXISTING-MODEL-FIRST ATTEMPT
Can the stronger witness already be represented and proved using the current
model, fixture, adapter, schema or runtime without adding architecture?

DISPROOF CONDITION
What result would prove the proposed architecture/capability unnecessary,
mis-scoped or incorrectly owned?

MEASUREMENT / EXECUTABLE ORACLE
How are current and required observations compared?
Use counts, identities, cardinalities, equalities, deltas, tolerances,
state transitions, browser observations or another claim-appropriate oracle.

AFTER-CHANGE PROOF
Only if the existing model actually fails: what before/after evidence proves
that the smallest change closes exactly the measured gap?

REGRESSION / INVARIANT CHECK
Which already-proved contracts must remain unchanged?

PRESSURE TEST
When a primitive is claimed to be reusable, what unrelated-domain or materially
different case challenges that generality?
```

Do not overload one word to mean both sides of the test:

- the **GAP WITNESS** is the case that can expose the alleged deficiency;
- the **DISPROOF CONDITION** is the outcome that defeats the proposed architecture or scope.

Prefer explicit state relations when they fit the claim, for example:

```text
undo(state_after) == state_before
delta(unrelated_instance) == 0
rejected_operation -> delta(canonical_state) == 0
expected_relationship_cardinality == observed_relationship_cardinality
abs(observed - required) <= justified_tolerance
```

These are examples of proof forms, not required architecture.

When the claimed property is meaningfully quantitative, prove it quantitatively.

When it is not naturally numerical, use a reproducible executable oracle rather than inventing numbers.

Do **not** accept LOC, commit count, PR count, issue count, number of tests, CI-run count or percentage-complete as proof of technical value. Test counts alone do not prove the invariant; the tests must exercise the claimed property.

### Probe/evidence task is not capability admission

An unproved technical hypothesis may justify a bounded **PROBE / EVIDENCE TASK** whose purpose is to execute the gap witness.

That does **not** mean the hypothesized product capability has been added to the roadmap denominator or accepted as required architecture.

Use this progression:

```text
HYPOTHESIS
→ PROBE / EVIDENCE TASK
→ execute gap witness
→ either NO PROVED GAP
   or PROVED GAP
→ only then consider capability ADD / REVISE / REPLACE
```

If the current system satisfies the witness and the disproof condition is met without the proposed addition, treat that as evidence **against adding architecture** and withdraw or narrow the proposal.

If the claim cannot yet be measured or executed, keep it as an **unproved hypothesis / evidence task**, not admitted product capability.

Do not enumerate attractive candidate architectures before the independent current-gap statement and technical challenge unless the target itself requires comparison of named alternatives.

Discover the missing primitive from the failing invariant, not the other way around.

Do not confuse the example that exposed a weakness with the reusable problem underneath it:

```text
river-crossing question
≠ automatically a river capability

900-page PDF freeze
≠ automatically a 900-page mode

one stale register entry
≠ automatically a need for a better register

failed test
≠ automatically an architecture problem
```

> **CRITIQUE THE CLAIM does not mean produce objections. It means try to disprove the claim with a gap witness, existing-model-first attempt, explicit disproof condition and claim-appropriate proof.**

## E. DECIDE — smallest justified movement

Only after STEP BACK, RECONCILE and CRITIQUE THE CLAIM should Prompt 3 decide.

For each material capability/task/artifact, choose the evidence-supported disposition:

```text
PRESERVE
REVISE
NARROW
SPLIT
REPLACE
ADD
DEFER
REMOVE / CLOSE
LEAVE UNCHANGED
```

Then identify the **smallest worthwhile next move**.

The evidence burden is symmetric:

- **ADD / REVISE / REPLACE / material implementation** require a proved deficiency, not architectural preference;
- **NARROW / REMOVE / CLOSE / transfer ownership** require positive evidence that the obligation is already satisfied, invalid, superseded, incorrectly owned, or unnecessary for the destination;
- **DEFER** requires a reason the capability may be valid but is not currently evidence-supported or urgent;
- **LEAVE UNCHANGED / PRESERVE** requires evidence that the current boundary still serves the destination.

Valid next moves include:

- run a bounded probe/evidence task without admitting a new capability;
- strengthen a fixture or proof rather than architecture;
- add, fix, extend, simplify or refactor a bounded capability after a proved gap;
- move work to the correct owner;
- reconcile a roadmap/task decomposition;
- gather one discriminating piece of evidence;
- present an owner decision;
- close or remove historical work on positive evidence;
- defer;
- preserve unchanged;
- or make no change yet.

Do not manufacture implementation because the user asked for a plan.

Before accepting the decision, return to the real witness and ask:

> Does the conclusion survive the example that exposed the issue?

> What observation would prove the chosen response unnecessary or wrong?

> What previously proved capability must remain unchanged?

> If the existing model already satisfies the stronger witness, are we correctly choosing proof/evidence work or no architecture change?

Only after this decision should delivery mechanics determine **how** the chosen move can be executed.

Delivery mechanics must never determine **what the system should become**.

## F. EXECUTE IF AUTHORIZED — then verify delivery truth

If the frozen USER INTENT authorizes implementation or external/repository action, execute the smallest justified move when evidence and authority permit.

Then:

```text
perform
→ test / verify
→ read back the actual repository or external state
→ report identifiers / links / evidence
→ state unresolved delivery constraints
```

Keep delivery constraints separate from technical direction.

A merge conflict, stale branch, missing write authority or CI failure may block execution or publication. It does not retroactively prove that a different architecture or roadmap direction is correct.

---

# HOW PROMPT 3 SHOULD END BY REQUEST MODE

These are **decision duties**, not mandatory artifact forms.

## CONCEIVE

Determine what should be built or become possible from first principles.

## REVIEW

Determine:

- what should be preserved;
- what has become historical;
- the meaningful remaining distance;
- what “complete enough now” should mean;
- the smallest sensible phased path;
- what should deliberately wait or never be built.

## CHANGE

Determine whether meaningful implementation/change work still remains.

If yes, rewrite the task in today's terms and identify the smallest durable change.

When USER INTENT authorizes implementation or external/repository action, execute that smallest justified change/action and verify it rather than stopping at a recommendation.

If no, say whether the issue should close, defer, become a decision, or move elsewhere; still satisfy any independent authorized coordination action the user explicitly requested unless its premise has been disproved.

## INVESTIGATE

Produce the best-supported conclusion, uncertainty and evidence that would overturn it.

Do not automatically convert a finding into implementation work.

## DECIDE

State the exact decision, viable options, evidence, consequences, reversibility, uncertainty, authority boundary and what each option gates.

Do not make an owner-reserved choice unless authorized.

## COORDINATE

Determine the truthful current state, real dependencies, decisions versus executable work, and the safe frontier.

Then decide whether the current coordination artifact should be preserved, reconciled, narrowed, split, replaced or closed.

Do not assume “COORDINATE” means force a better version of the current artifact.

## HANDOVER

Transmit enough understanding that a successor can continue with correct judgement.

The handover must preserve reasoning, not merely operational state.

Run the PROMPT-3 FREEDOM GATE before accepting Prompt 3.

---

# POST-THREE-PASS TERMINAL RULE — NO FOLLOW-ON QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS

Completing Prompt 3 completes the three-pass reasoning sequence, regardless of whether Prompt 1 used visible Q1–Q5 / complex reasoning.

Prompt 3 must instruct the future agent to finish its response with:

```text
THREE_PASS_REASONING_STATUS: THREE_PASS_COMPLETE
FOLLOW_ON_QUALIFICATION_QUESTION_SET: NOT_APPLICABLE
```

After that disposition:

- do not ask another qualification questionnaire;
- do not create a follow-on `QSET-*` merely to re-test the reasoning already exercised by the three passes;
- do not insert an extra admission/exam stage after Prompt 3;
- if a downstream execution workflow needs a machine-readable basis, carry `THREE_PASS_COMPLETE` forward as the reason the extra qualification question set is not applicable.

This does **not** mean evidence, authorization, tests, source authority, Owner decisions, local execution, or write-safety checks may be skipped. It only removes redundant post-three-pass questioning.

A separate qualification exercise may occur only when the user explicitly asks for one as a new task.

---

# RESTRAINT IS A FIRST-CLASS REQUIREMENT

All three generated prompts should encourage restraint.

The future agent should repeatedly ask:

> What are we tempted to build that we should not build?

> Is this genuinely required by the human outcome?

> Are we filling an honest gap merely because empty space looks uncomfortable?

> Are we creating a special case when a reusable idea already exists?

> Are we mistaking more architecture for more progress?

> Are we mistaking passing tests for proof that the human outcome works?

> Are we carrying an old plan forward only because nobody explicitly retired it?

A mature result may conclude:

> Leave this alone.

> Wait for real evidence.

> This is already good enough for this stage.

> The architecture is sufficient; author content instead.

> The content is sufficient; test with real people instead.

---

# HUMAN-LANGUAGE RULE

Write the generated prompts so that they engage judgment and imagination.

Prefer:

> Imagine the learner.

> Imagine the person opening the document.

> Imagine the developer returning six months later.

> Follow what really happens.

> Ask what the person is trying to accomplish.

> Ask what has already been learned by the project.

> Find the reusable idea underneath the example.

Avoid turning the prompts into machine-level jargon.

Do not overuse terms such as:

- execution graph;
- reconciliation engine;
- ontology completion;
- state machine;
- delta processor;
- classification pipeline.

Technical language is fine where the domain genuinely requires it, but the reasoning prompts themselves should remain human-readable.

---

# HANDOVER REQUIREMENT — HAND OVER THE REASONING, NOT THE ACTIVITY LOG

Prompt 3 must end with a **reasoning handover**.

The original purpose of this method is continuity of judgement. The next agent should be able to understand **why this is the right next move**, not merely recover file names, commits, branches, or a task list.

Use this shape, adapted naturally to the target:

```text
DESTINATION
What were we ultimately trying to make possible?
Use the human/reference picture, not the implementation vocabulary.

REALITY
What did we learn the current system/task actually is today?
What surprised us or changed the meaning of the original plan?

REAL GAP
After comparing destination and reality, what meaningful distance genuinely remains?
State the gap in today's language.

CHOSEN MOVE
What is the smallest worthwhile response now, and why this rather than something larger?

INTENT RESULT
What did the user explicitly ask the agent to accomplish?
Was it completed?
If an authorized action was performed, what verified identifier/link/evidence proves it?
If not, what exact evidence/authority/capability blocked it?

DELIBERATELY NOT DONE
What tempting work are we intentionally leaving alone, and why?
Include work already solved, unsupported by evidence, outside authority, or unnecessary.

REAL EVIDENCE / EXAMPLE
What concrete example, user journey, question, model, failure, benchmark, or observation
most strongly supports the conclusion?

UNRESOLVED
What remains uncertain, owner-gated, evidence-limited, or intentionally deferred?

WHERE THE NEXT AGENT SHOULD START
What should the next agent look at first, and what understanding should they carry with them?

WHAT SHOULD CHANGE OUR MIND
What future evidence or discovery would justify taking a different direction?
```

For repositories and engineering tasks, operational details such as branch, commit, PR topology, or exact next command may be added **after** this reasoning relay when genuinely useful.

They must not replace it.

The governing principle is:

> **Do not hand over what you did. Hand over what you understood.**

A good handover should let a fresh agent reconstruct the journey:

```text
destination
→ current reality
→ meaningful remaining distance
→ smallest justified move
→ evidence
→ uncertainty
→ next judgement
```

This is the same reasoning continuity used by the successful product-level and task-level applications of the method.

# STRICT OUTPUT CONTRACT FOR THE GENERATOR

The complete generator output begins with the mandatory **SCHEMA EXECUTION HANDSHAKE**, followed by one shared **SCHEMA BASIS** section.

Then, for **each requested lot**, output four visible sections:

1. one **PREFLIGHT RECORD**;
2. exactly three **copy-pasteable prompt blocks**.

The preflight is metadata, **not a fourth prompt**.

If the user requested two lots, output two lot sections. Do not merge them and do not invent a different second target.

Output this structure and nothing else:

### Copy-pasteability rules

Each of the five prompt fences must be directly pasteable into another agent **without editing**.

Therefore:

- no commentary before or after a prompt inside its fence;
- no phrases such as "here is Prompt 1";
- no analysis notes mixed into the prompt;
- no "two notes on how I applied the schema" after the prompts;
- no nested fenced code blocks inside a prompt fence;
- if a prompt needs a diagram, table, template, or mini-structure, express it as plain indented text inside the outer fence;
- no placeholders that the user must manually replace when the information is already known;
- Prompt 2, Prompt 2.5 and Prompt 3 must contain the actual target/repository links when available;
- Prompt 3 must contain the actual identity capsule, not instructions saying to add one later.

### Pass-specific identity rule

**Prompt 0.5 — IMAGINE FROM PROGRAMME**

Use the stable original roadmap / large-project goal, governing issue responsibility and only a short local-task purpose capsule. Ask for independent project-level reasoning and non-obvious value hypotheses. Do **not** include current PR/branch/task status or current solution material. Explicitly subordinate the local task to the project and governing-issue goals.

**Prompt 1 — IMAGINE**

Use TARGET ANCHORS, PROBLEM KERNEL where applicable, human outcome, genuine constraints, domain, and imagination object.

Do not include live current-system links or current-answer material.

Do not explain this omission inside Prompt 1. The prompt should read as a complete human/domain scenario, not as a methodology instruction.

**Prompt 2 — UNDERSTAND**

Include the exact target and repository/system links when available.

**Prompt 2.5 — RECONCILE REALITY AND DIRECTION**

Include enough target/repository identity to re-check live evidence. Require both a reality refresh and comparison against Prompt 0.5 + Prompt 1 + Prompt 2 before stating the current gap and evidence-supported direction.

**Prompt 3 — REVALIDATE AND MOVE FORWARD**

Include this identity capsule with real resolved values:

```text
TARGET:
<exact title/name>

TARGET LINK:
<canonical target URL>

REPOSITORY / SYSTEM:
<parent repository/system>

REPOSITORY LINK:
<canonical repository/system URL>

UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM:
<the blind problem Prompt 1 was built from>

USER INTENT:
<the frozen operational intent>

AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:
<the frozen authorized actions>
```

Omit only fields that genuinely do not exist.

### No extra output

Do not add:

- a sixth prompt;
- explanatory prose before the preflight;
- commentary between prompt blocks;
- implementation notes after Prompt 3;
- a second summary of how you applied the schema.

The shared SCHEMA BASIS plus each lot's visible preflight and five prompt fences are the complete deliverable.

After Prompt 3, STOP. Do not append any admission/qualification/certification block, evaluator request, sixth stage, or extra question package.

Each generated Prompt 3 must itself instruct its future agent to emit the terminal disposition `THREE_PASS_REASONING_STATUS: THREE_PASS_COMPLETE` and `FOLLOW_ON_QUALIFICATION_QUESTION_SET: NOT_APPLICABLE` when that pass is finished.

---

# SILENT QUALITY CHECKS BEFORE OUTPUT

Do not show these checks outside the visible gate results in the PREFLIGHT RECORD.

### Lot-count / level-fidelity check

Does the output contain exactly the number of lots the user requested?

Does each lot preserve the requested level exactly?

If a tab-level lot became an issue-level lot, fail.

### Specificity-floor check

Is Prompt 1 recognisably about this exact requested target and level?

Could it be pasted unchanged into many unrelated projects?

If yes, fail as too generic.

### Schema-freshness check

When canonical GitHub is the schema source, is `SCHEMA FETCH STATUS = LIVE_THIS_RUN` with a real current content SHA?

If not, fail before evaluating prompts.

### Legacy-signature check

Does the generated deliverable contain any retired active field/instruction listed by the LEGACY-SIGNATURE REJECTION GATE?

If yes, fail and regenerate from current schema.

### Visible-preflight check

Is the complete PREFLIGHT RECORD visible?

If it is hidden or replaced by “preflight completed,” fail.

### Copy-pasteability check

Are Prompt 0.5, Prompt 1, Prompt 2, Prompt 2.5 and Prompt 3 each isolated in one clean outer text fence and directly pasteable without editing?

If there is commentary mixed into a prompt, known placeholders, nested fences, or notes after Prompt 3, fail.

### Complex-mode Q1–Q5 check

If COMPLEX MODE is ON, does Prompt 1 cover all five human reasoning lenses from Appendix H?

Specifically:
- path/ownership/consumer;
- concrete reconstruction;
- change/invariant/falsifier;
- independent check;
- first bounded proof slice.

If any lens is missing, fail.

Do not accept five generic bullet questions. They must be expressed in the language of this target and its PROBLEM KERNEL.

### Prompt-1 repository-leak formula check

Derive the actual repository identity from the preflight and require:

```text
PROMPT_1_REPOSITORY_LEAK_SCORE = 0
```

Count repository URL/path, owner/repo slug, exact repository-name leakage, and meta/prohibition language about opening, inspecting, referring to, or avoiding the repository.

Do not treat "do not refer to repo X" as safe; the repository was still revealed.

### Human-immersion check

Does Prompt 1 begin inside the person's real situation and stay there?

Fail if it mentions later passes, fixed references, repositories to avoid inspecting, schema mechanics, gates, quarantine, or being "held to" a future comparison.

The method must be invisible in Prompt 1.

### Problem-witness check

For ISSUE_TASK, did the target contain a real benchmark/example/trace/dataset/drawing/journey/dependency case that materially exposes the issue?

If yes, does Prompt 1 actually use it and demand a concrete independent work product?

If not, fail as abstract.

### Witness-independence check

Are reported witness outputs framed as claims to reproduce/falsify rather than truths to inherit?

Is today's interpretation/recommendation still quarantined?

If not, fail as contaminated.

### Task-contract fidelity check

For ISSUE_TASK, does Prompt 1 preserve the issue's WHY NOW, starting premise, responsible actor/job, owned question, and relevant ownership boundary?

If not, fail as over-generalised.

### Neighbour-separation check

Could Prompt 1 serve the parent or nearest sibling issue unchanged?

If yes, fail.

### Human Q-label check

If Q1–Q5 labels are visible, do they sound like natural, target-specific questions/tasks a practitioner would actually ask?

Reject taxonomy labels and protocol metadata.

### Mode-isolation check

When COMPLEX MODE is ON, are Q1–Q5 expressed only as Prompt-1 reasoning lenses?

Reject any extra question package, routing metadata, certification/qualification block, evaluator requirement, or admission stage inserted between the three prompts.

### Same-issue identity check

For ISSUE_TASK, after removing the title/number, is the particular issue still distinguishable from sibling issues?

If not, restore the PROBLEM KERNEL.

### Kernel-coverage check

For ISSUE_TASK, does every load-bearing PROBLEM KERNEL fact materially survive into Prompt 1?

If not, the prompt is too generic.

### Answer-exclusion check

For ISSUE_TASK, does any CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE fact leak into Prompt 1 directly or through generic paraphrase?

If yes, remove it.

### Goldilocks-corridor check

Is the issue-level Prompt 1 simultaneously:

- recognisable as this issue; and
- not pre-solved by today's issue text?

Both must pass.

### Reality-quarantine check

Are CURRENT ARTIFACT FORM, CURRENT STATED ANSWER / IMPLEMENTATION, and CURRENT-STATE FACTS absent from Prompt 1 unless independently justified as genuine constraints?

### Artifact-erasure check

If today's issue/artifact/implementation disappeared, would Prompt 1 still make essentially the same sense?

If not, fail.

### Current-vocabulary check

Did any important Prompt-1 noun or scenario detail come from today's target rather than the blind human problem?

If yes, remove it unless independently justified.

### Laundered-generalisation check

Did the generator merely replace issue-specific proper nouns with generic nouns while preserving today's issue narrative?

If yes, fail.

The correction is:
- restore the stable PROBLEM KERNEL;
- remove today's options/evidence interpretation/implementation answer.

### Human-problem check

Does UNDERLYING HUMAN PROBLEM describe what would still need solving if the current artifact had never existed?

### Prompt-1 object check

Would a perfect answer to Prompt 1 create the independent reference picture needed for that underlying problem?

### Reality check

Does Prompt 2 force inspection of live evidence rather than trusting issue prose or old plans?

### In-flight-work check

Does Prompt 2 distinguish current baseline from relevant near-future work without pretending open work is merged?

### Prompt-2/3 identity check

When links exist, does Prompt 2 contain the exact target and repository/system links?

Does Prompt 3 independently identify the exact target and repository/system?

Prompt 1 may omit live links to protect blindness.

### Intent-fidelity check

Does the three-prompt sequence preserve what the user actually wants accomplished, not merely what should be understood?

For `ANALYZE_THEN_ACT` / `EXECUTE_DEFINED_ACTION`:

- does Prompt 2 inspect action prerequisites?
- does Prompt 3 instruct actual execution?
- does Prompt 3 require readback/verification?
- can it only stop short for a concrete evidence/authority/capability reason?

If not, fail.

### Goalpost check

Does Prompt 3 explicitly return to the exact Prompt-1 answer?

### Artifact-survival freedom check

Can Prompt 3 legitimately preserve, update, narrow, split, replace, close, defer, move elsewhere or leave unchanged today's artifact?

If it mandates an improved version of the artifact before comparison, fail.

### Rediscovery check

Does Prompt 3 ask what the goal/problem means **now**, rather than merely count old checklist items?

### Example-vs-problem check

Does Prompt 3 distinguish the exposing example from the reusable problem underneath it?

### Restraint check

Can Prompt 3 conclude no change, close, defer, collect evidence first, or leave this alone?

### Evidence check

Does Prompt 3 return to real examples/evidence to test the conclusion?

### Handover-reasoning check

Does Prompt 3 hand over:

```text
destination
→ reality
→ real gap
→ chosen move
→ deliberately not done
→ real evidence/example
→ unresolved
→ where next
→ what changes our mind
```

If handover is mainly branch/commit/PR topology or a task checklist, fail.

Operational details may supplement the reasoning relay, never replace it.

If any check fails, revise before output.

# COMPLEX MODE — Q1–Q5 HUMAN REASONING


Use this appendix **only when COMPLEX MODE = ON** because the user explicitly used the word **complex** for that target/lot.

Complex mode is defined **entirely inside this schema**.

The five reasoning lenses are:

```text
Q1 — trace the real path from inputs/evidence to the result or decision that matters,
     including where authority comes from and who relies on it.

Q2 — independently reconstruct one concrete real case; for quantitative work,
     use the real payload when available and show intermediate reasoning.

Q3 — change one load-bearing input/assumption; state what should change,
     what must remain invariant, and what observation would falsify the model.

Q4 — verify the important conclusion by a genuinely independent route;
     reproduce reported comparisons rather than inheriting them.

Q5 — return to the issue's owned question and identify the smallest
     no-regret or uncertainty-reducing next move.
```

These are **Prompt-1 reasoning lenses only**.

They do not create another workflow stage, question package, admission step, evaluator requirement, or protocol outside Prompt 1.

In **Prompt 1**, preserve the reasoning intent but translate it into a first-principles human conversation.

The future agent should not be told about the hidden/current-system distinction; that separation is enforced by the generator.

## Governing rule

> **Complex mode makes Prompt 1 deeper, not more mechanical.**

Do not paste external workflow/certification vocabulary into Prompt 1.

Do not ask the future agent to inspect current files, functions, current state owners, current benchmarks, or current implementation steps.

Instead ask the human equivalents below using the target's own domain language and PROBLEM KERNEL.

## Q1 — Human path: how does truth travel?

Canonical intent:

```text
production path
state owner
authority source
downstream consumer
```

Human Prompt-1 form:

> Start with the selected PROBLEM WITNESS when one exists. Trace the real path from its physical/business/learning inputs to the result or decision that matters. Where does each important quantity, fact or authority come from? What is source-defined, what is derived, what is assumed, and who relies on the result next?

Adapt this to the target.

Examples:

```text
engineering tab:
drawing + geometry + loads
→ interpretation
→ governed calculation
→ result
→ engineering review

learning issue:
real question
→ learner action required
→ prerequisite
→ teaching location
→ learner retry
```

The point is to expose the natural chain of custody/meaning without knowing today's architecture.

## Q2 — Human reconstruction: can we work one real case through?

Canonical intent:

```text
engineering reconstruction
concrete payload values when quantitative
intermediate result
expected result
```

Human Prompt-1 form:

> Work the selected real witness through from beginning to end. If it is quantitative, use the actual retained payload when available and show intermediate reasoning. If a reported output exists, reproduce or falsify it independently. Identify exactly where source-defined reasoning ends and any extra assumption begins.

If no real witness exists, then choose one representative case and use plausible values.

For non-quantitative targets, reconstruct the actual example/dependency/journey rather than inventing a generic scenario.

This question prevents complex Prompt 1 from becoming abstract consultancy prose.

## Q3 — Human stress test: what changes, what must not, and what would prove us wrong?

Canonical intent:

```text
explicit mutation
protected invariant
exact falsifier
```

Human Prompt-1 form:

> Now change one important thing. What should legitimately change because of it? What must remain true no matter what? What observation would make you stop and say, "our understanding is wrong"?

When a witness exists, mutate one of its load-bearing inputs, assumptions, authority conditions, or dependencies.

Use a change that belongs to the PROBLEM KERNEL, not today's bug list.

Examples:

```text
change a load
change geometry
change a prerequisite
change a document size
change an authority assumption
change the order of one dependency
```

The answer should reveal the deep invariant and a real falsifier.

## Q4 — Human independent check: how would we know without trusting ourselves?

Canonical intent:

```text
independent verification
benchmark/oracle
predicted result
tolerance/exactness
```

Human Prompt-1 form:

> Check the witness by a genuinely independent route. If the witness itself is an external benchmark, first build your own transparent calculation/derivation and only then compare against the benchmark. Recalculate any reported agreement yourself. Explain what the comparison supports and, separately, what it cannot establish.

Possible independent routes include a hand calculation, second source, benchmark, physical argument, second representation, real example, or separately derived dependency analysis.

Where meaningful, ask what level of agreement would count and why.

Independence matters more than having many checks.

## Q5 — Human discriminating next step: what is the smallest no-regret or uncertainty-reducing move?

Canonical intent:

```text
first safe bounded change
predicted before
predicted after
verification
```

Prompt 1 must not turn this into a patch plan for today's repository.

Translate it according to the issue type.

For implementation/technical-proof issues, it may be a **first bounded proof**.

For decision, coordination, sequencing, or closure issues, it may instead be the **smallest no-regret action or discriminating evidence step**:

> Given what the independent witness taught you, what is the smallest next move that either reduces uncertainty about the OWNED QUESTION or produces value under all plausible dispositions? What would you predict before doing it? What result would make you proceed, wait, narrow, move work elsewhere, or stop?

Valid Q5 conclusions include:

```text
another calculation
a deliberately discriminating benchmark
collect one missing piece of evidence
prepare an owner decision
do work useful under either outcome
wait
defer
no further technical work yet
```

Do not manufacture implementation merely because Q5 asks for a next step.

## ISSUE_TASK anchoring for complex Q1–Q5

For ISSUE_TASK, every Q1–Q5 lens must answer the **OWNED QUESTION**.

Do not let complex mode broaden the prompt into the product, parent programme, or end-user journey unless the issue itself owns that level.

In particular:

- Q1 traces the truth/authority path through the selected witness and ties it to this issue's decision.
- Q2 independently reconstructs the witness using its real payload when available.
- Q3 mutates a witness input/assumption or task-contract premise and protects the issue's invariant.
- Q4 independently checks the witness/report and separates evidence from authority/conclusion.
- Q5 returns to the OWNED QUESTION and chooses the smallest no-regret or uncertainty-reducing move.

For a coordination/decision issue with a technical witness, do **not** force Q2 to be a generic programme case.
Work the technical witness first if understanding it is what makes the coordination/decision question intelligible.

Each lens must materially connect back to the ISSUE TASK CONTRACT.

## Human weaving requirement

Do not produce five disconnected exam questions.

The preferred shape is a natural progression:

```text
Start with the concrete problem witness.
→ trace how the real inputs become a result/decision
→ independently work/reconstruct the witness
→ disturb one important input/assumption
→ check the reported result/conclusion independently
→ return to the issue's OWNED QUESTION
→ identify the smallest no-regret or uncertainty-reducing move
```

Prompt 1 may use paragraphs, a journey, or conversational questions.

The labels Q1–Q5 are for the generator's internal coverage check, not normally for the future agent.

## Human-visible Q1–Q5 labels

The internal Q1–Q5 semantics are coverage categories, not surface language.

If the user explicitly asks to see Q1 through Q5, keep the numbers but translate every visible heading into a short, natural, target-specific question or task.

Use this test:

> **Would an experienced practitioner actually say this heading to another practitioner across a desk?**

If no, rewrite it.

For a quantitative engineering case, good headings might be:

```text
Q1 — From these real inputs, where does the governing method take you?
Q2 — Can you reproduce the reported result yourself?
Q3 — What changes when the case moves outside the directly supported condition?
Q4 — Why does the independent comparison agree, and what does that actually prove?
Q5 — Given what you learned, what is actually worth doing next?
```

Do not expose machine identifiers, schema field names, evidence-control metadata, or internal reasoning-category names in Prompt 1.

The future agent should encounter a real question, not a schema field.

---

## Relationship to the three-pass method

Complex Q1–Q5 mode affects **Prompt 1 only**.

```text
PROMPT 0.5
independent global reasoning:
project / roadmap goal → governing issue → short subordinate local-task context

PROMPT 1
independent human Q1–Q5 reasoning picture

PROMPT 2
live repository/system reality

PROMPT 2.5
fresh reality + Prompt-1 baseline + programme hierarchy
→ integrated current-gap and direction synthesis

PROMPT 3
revalidate Prompt-2.5 against current evidence
→ execute the smallest justified authorized response and hand over
```

Do not repeat Q1–Q5 mechanically in Prompts 0.5, 2, 2.5 or 3 unless the target itself genuinely benefits from those questions.

## Complex-mode anti-generic test

A complex Prompt 1 fails if the five questions could be copied unchanged to an unrelated project.

Each lens must use:
- the correct user-requested level;
- TARGET ANCHORS;
- PROBLEM KERNEL where applicable;
- concrete domain objects;
- the selected PROBLEM WITNESS when one exists;
- a concrete INDEPENDENT WORK PRODUCT;
- a realistic person/journey;
- genuine constraints.

Complex mode should make the prompt **more concrete and diagnostic**, not longer for its own sake.

## Example — complex issue-level engineering decision with a benchmark witness

Weak:

> Trace the process. Reconstruct the problem. State the invariant. Validate independently. Pick a first slice.

Still too mechanical.

Also weak:

> How should a responsible organisation decide whether to continue a release programme?

Too abstract when the issue already contains a real engineering case.

Better:

> Start with the retained real-vessel benchmark case that creates the tension. Reconstruct its physical geometry, loads, nondimensional parameters and governing-source path. Work the calculation transparently as far as the source permits. If the source does not specify a required non-tabulated step, stop and identify the exact missing rule before exploring any extra assumption.
>
> Then independently reproduce the reported external-software comparison. Recalculate the differences and governing location yourself. Explain separately what close numerical agreement supports and what it cannot establish about source/method authority.
>
> Perturb the case across meaningful input/authority conditions. Identify the invariant and a real falsifier.
>
> Finally return to the issue-level decision: given what this concrete case taught you, which downstream work is no-regret, which is conditional on an owner disposition, what evidence would most reduce uncertainty, and when is doing nothing yet the correct next move?

That is Q1–Q5 in human form because the concrete witness drives the reasoning rather than decorating it.

---

# REGRESSION OWNERSHIP

Historical target-specific regressions, stale-output examples and exact forbidden signatures belong in executable tests and validators, not in this production schema.

The production schema must remain target-neutral so it cannot supply stale answer-side context for the very target it is asked to generate.

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

The generator should make a future agent think in this order:

```text
Prove the current schema basis first.

Read the user-authoritative target carefully.

What answer/form does the target currently carry?
Quarantine that.

If today's artifact and implementation had never existed,
what human problem would still remain?

Before seeing today's answer,
what would strong handling of that problem look like?

What is actually true today?

Put the independent picture beside reality.

Does today's artifact deserve to survive in its current form?

What meaningful distance genuinely remains?

What is the smallest justified response?

What claim-specific falsifier or proof confirms or challenges that conclusion?

What should the relevant roadmap/task landscape preserve, revise, narrow, split, replace, add, defer, remove/close, or leave unchanged?

What understanding must the next person inherit?
```

The method is constant:

> **Read the target to discover the problem behind it. Then mentally throw away the target's current answer for Prompt 1.**

Prompt 1 is independent not only of the code, but—where possible—of the current solution form itself.

But independence is not vagueness.

> **Prompt 1 must be blind to today's answer while remaining richly specific to the user-requested target, level, domain and job-to-be-done.**

The user's lot boundaries are authoritative. A tab-level request stays tab-level; a related issue becomes evidence, not a substitute target.

For issue-level work, preserve the **ISSUE TASK CONTRACT**, then its **PROBLEM KERNEL**, and—when one exists—the **PROBLEM WITNESS** that makes the issue concrete. Explicitly quarantine the current answer and the current interpretation of that witness:

> **Erase today's answer, not the facts that make it the same issue.**

Construction rule:

```text
Prompt 1 =
ISSUE TASK CONTRACT
+ PROBLEM KERNEL
+ TARGET ANCHORS
+ PROBLEM WITNESS when available
+ HUMAN OUTCOME
+ GENUINE CONSTRAINTS
- CURRENT ANSWER QUARANTINE
- WITNESS INTERPRETATION QUARANTINE
```

The issue-level blind pass must live inside the Goldilocks corridor:

```text
recognisable as this issue
but
not reconstructable as today's answer
```

That means two independent axes must both be correct:

```text
IDENTITY PRESERVATION
keep the facts that make it this issue

ANSWER INDEPENDENCE
remove the facts that tell you how today's repository has chosen to answer it
```

Do not trade one for the other.

When the user explicitly says **complex**, add one more requirement:

> **Prompt 1 must reason through Q1–Q5 in human form: trace the real witness/path, independently reconstruct it, stress/falsify it, verify it independently, then return to the issue's owned question and choose the smallest no-regret or uncertainty-reducing move.**

Complexity must deepen specificity and falsifiability; it must never become generic ceremony.

Internal Q1–Q5 taxonomy must also disappear at the surface:

> **If Q1–Q5 are shown, their labels must sound like real questions/tasks from the target domain, not names of reasoning categories.**

Prompt 1 must also be **method-invisible**:

> **The future agent should experience a real person, real job, real objects, real stakes and real questions — not instructions about the three-pass method.**

Blindness is enforced by the generator, not narrated to the agent.

Prompt 2 brings reality back and establishes the prerequisites for the user's operational intent.

Prompt 3 decides what deserves to survive **and then fulfills the frozen user intent** when authorized and justified.

> **Do not confuse freedom to reject today's solution with freedom to ignore the user's requested outcome or action.**

The handover preserves the reasoning journey so the next agent inherits understanding, not merely activity.
